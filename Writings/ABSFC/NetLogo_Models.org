* Introduction

The purpose of this file is to document all model versions used in my dissertation.
In order to keep versions maintainable, the main principal across them is *retro compatibility*.
It means that one user could move between versions just selecting an specific flag.
In order to do so, some conventions will be employed as described in the next section.

* NetLogo study plans and examples :noexport:

This section is for self control only, thus, not exported.

** TODO Check way emacs shell times more time to run
** TODO Check if BehaviorSpace overwrites variables set in the setup procedure
- Experiments defined with behaviour space replaces the define in the =.nlogo= code?

** DONE How to report more than one variable in BehaviourSpace together
CLOSED: [2021-06-24 qui 18:42]

- Just add anoter =<metric>other-variable<\metric>= line

** KILL Change JAR
CLOSED: [2021-06-24 qui 18:40]

Not necessary


** TODO Check if netlogo included section still work
** DONE Run model using command line

** TODO Input external data on simulations

** TODO Export results without behaviour space

** TODO Create functions to export results to other programming languages

** TODO See nlrx package ([[https://github.com/ropensci/nlrx][link]])

** TODO Necessity to set seed
* Housekeeping instructions and conventions

All models must use the *literate programming* paradigm to be more non-programmer friendly.
Since NetLogo code in non-linear (in terms of non-programming writing), this file will base on *noweb* tangle mechanism.
In order to avoid copy-and-paste and mismatches across files, this document use the *transclusion* procedure.
Model's last version will be called =current-version.nlogo= while previous versions should be renamed using its activation flag.
While a model is a current version, its =:tangle= property will be overwriten by the current version section, after that, it will be renamed as =activation-flag.nlogo= using the respective section property.
To track all versions, each outdated model will be transcluded in the respective section and removed from current version heading.
Before moving to the next version, some steps must be checked:

| Current version?                  | Yes (No)                 |
|-----------------------------------+--------------------------|





* Variables and parameter

All versions must be *syntax coherent*, thus this section tracks its NetLogo and $\LaTeX$ labels, description, first implementation date (since), divergent behavior across versions (breaks).
Each model version will descrebe each variable/parameter in more detail.

| NetLogo | LaTeX | Description | Since | Versions breaks | Notes |
|---------+-------+-------------+-------+-----------------+-------|



* Change logs and implementation plans

This section is similar to =info= tab in NetLogo GUI.
Additionally, each model must describe its contribution related to previous or milestones versions.
In order to avoid copy-and-paste, the respective section is transcluded.
Dates in section heading indicates intended implementation deadline.

** STRT One house price diffusion (=one-diffusion=) <2021-06-26 sáb>

None.
This is the first model.

** TODO Homogeneous wages and no firms (=homogeneous-wages-nofirms=) <2021-07-15 qui>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions
In addition to the previous version, this model creates homogeneous households in terms of wages.
A share of them will be house owner while the other will not.
In this version, there is no rent payment.
The main issue here is to deal with households that are *homeless*.

** TODO Household entry and exit (=entry-exit=) <2021-07-24 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions
This version will have a households entry and exit flow.
The main difficulty in this version is to decide this mobility rules.

** TODO Rent and no internal mobility (=rent-no-internal-mobility=) <2021-08-07 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

In this version, no house owner households will pay rents to householders.
This version could incur in stock-flow inconsistency, thus the main ideia is to map them.
New mechanism must be related to external mobility.

** TODO Internal mobility and random choose (=random-choose=) <2021-08-14 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

In addition, to the previous version, households are allowed to move-out.
Thus, this version must have to decision rules which include when to move out.
For simplicity reasons, the new house is chosen randomly.

** TODO House searching, no transaction and no construction (=house-searching=) <2021-08-21 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions
Now, households choose where to live according to some rule.
However, for simplicity, there is no transaction nor house construction, and thus no residential investment.
In this sense, renters will be always renters in this version.

** TODO Buying and sell without construction or credit (=buy-sell-no-credit=) <2021-08-28 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions
In this versions, households are allowed to buy houses if they have enough net wealth since is a economy without credit.
Additionally, households that intend to buy or sell will have asks and bids.
Other relevant topic is to implement mismatches rules if buy/sell are not succeeded.

** TODO Household credit without construction (=credit-no-construction=) <2021-09-11 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions
Now on, the model will have a new agent *banks* which evaluate households net balance to grant credit.
As a consequence, a bunch of new variables must be included such as mortgages, interest rate, loan to value, etc.
Since there is no construction sector, banks will evaluate only houses.

** TODO Construction model with fixed capital stock (=construction-fixed-capital=) <2021-09-25 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

This is other milestone model with a new agent type.
In order to produce, construction sector need to hire workers and use a fixed (but renovabel) capital stock since there is no other sector.
Since banks are included, firms will have access to credit as well.
Two of the main modifications is the endogenous employment mechanism as well as a variable house stock.
This version must deal with environmental limits and landspace geography.

** TODO Construction and capital goods sector (=construction-capital=) <2021-10-09 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

This economy will have two sectors.
The additional one provides capital goods to the other.
Labor demand rules will be in action now on, so firms dispute for households while households must decide where to work.
Some key simplifying assumptions will be necessary.

** TODO Consumption goods (=consumption-goods=) <2021-10-16 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

This is a minor change: consumption goods inclusion.
All necessary modifications could be mirroed from the other sectors.

** TODO Government (=government=) <2021-10-30 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

In this versions, there is a new agent: government.
After that, there is an agent that consume other sectors' production, pays unemployment benefits and set some policy variables.

** TODO Moving to Bechmark (=no-callibrated-benchmark=) <2021-11-13 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

At this stage, the model is close to the dissertation's first model.
Thus, this step is to ensure the remaining modifications.

** TODO Calibrating benchmark (=calibrated-benchmark=) <2021-11-27 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

This is the calibrated benchmark model.
After this step, the baseline model is live!

** TODO Experiments (=baseline-experiments=) <2021-12-11 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

By definition, this version should only change parameters/global variables.

** TODO Analysis and report results (=baseline-analysis=) <2022-01-15 sáb>

*** Model Info

*** Changes between versions

This is the last stage before moving to the next model.

** TODO Moving to gentrification version

*** Model Info

*** TODO Changes between versions
