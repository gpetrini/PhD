* Introduction

** Description

This model aims do represent a simple economy with a housing sector.
The ideia is to define the minimal assumptions in order to reproduce the housing market and production dynamics between agents.
There will be four types of agents: Households (subscript $h$), Firms (subscript $f$), Government (subscript $g$) and Bank (subscript $b$).

Households will be divided into three classes: Landowners ($hl$), Capitalists ($hc$) and Workers ($hw$).
In order to produce houses, there is the constructor sector ($fc$) and the concrete producer sector ($fk$).
Banks provides credit only for production while government collects taxes and pays unemployment benefits.
For simplicity, there is no speculation yet.

* Households

Since there is only a constructor and a concrete producer sector, households do not buy consumption goods for simplicity[fn::The consumption goods sector will be employed in other versions of the model as well as capital goods sector.].
In this sense, households wages are similar to renevue net of consumption.
Thus, households demand corresponds only to housing related expenditures.
As a consequence, households can rent or buy a house unit.

In order to evaluate if heterogeneity persists or emerges in the model, all wages are equal across workers.
Capitalists households receives a equally share of distributed profits of both firms.
Landowners income is based on rents.
The share of each type of households is fixed.

Since there is no assumption about full-employment of production factors, we assume that persistent unemployment exists.
In this sense, government expenditures are destinated to unemployment workers only.


** Main source of income ($Y_{hi}$)

Workers receives wages ($W$) that are equal by construction. Thus, the income for worker household ($Y_{hw}$) is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{hw} = W_{hw}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

Capitalists, on the other hand, receives profits ($FD_{fi}$) so its income ($Y_{hc}$) is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{hc} = FD_{fi}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $i$ indicates the firm that pays dividends.

Finally, landowners receives land's rent while the house unit  is not sold ($R_{house}$) nor produced ($R_{land}$).
If the house unit is bought by a household, receives its value.

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{hl} = R_{house} + R_{land} + p_{h}\cdot H
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $p_{H}$ stands for the house price if a house unit ($H$) is sold.


** Disposable income ($YD_{hi}$)


Disposable income is similar across households.
The only divergence is that only workers are allowed to receive unemployment benefits ($Unem$).
Disposable income is defined as the main source of income ($Y_{hi}$) net of taxes ($\tau$) added with interest rate ($r_{g}$) on money deposits ($M$).

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
YD_{hi} = (1-\tau)\cdot Y_{hi} + r_{g}\cdot M_{t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


** "Consumption" (Rents)

In this toy model, households consumption is equivalent to house's rent.
Thus, only workers consume while capitalists and landowners expenditures are houses acquisitions.


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
C_{hi} = R_{house}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


** Savings ($S_{hi}$)
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
S_{hi} = YD_{hi} - C_{hi}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

** Demand for residential investment ($RI_{hi}$)

In this simplest version without mortgages or banking credit, desired real residential investment demand is equal to:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
RI^{d}_{hi} = \eta V_{hi}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $\eta$ is a share of desired level of housing expenditures.
As a consequence, money deposits are residual:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{hi} = \Delta M_{hi} + p_{H}\cdot \Delta H
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta M_{hi} = V_{hi,t} - V_{hi,t-1} - \eta\cdot V_{hi,t}\cdot p_{H} = (1-\eta\cdot p_{H})\cdot V_{hi} - V_{hi,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


Actual residential investment ($RI$) will depend on both asks and bids on housing market as well as on the price of the searched houses.

** Wealth ($V_{hi}$)

Since there is two types of stocks, households' real wealth is defined as:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
V_{hi} = M_{hi} + p_{H}\cdot H
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{hi} = S_{hi} + CGH
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $CGH$ is capital gain with houses as in:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
CGH = \Delta p_{H} \cdot H_{t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

* Government

Government collects a fixed tax rate ($\tau$) across households.
Expenditure ($G$) is restricted to unemployment benefits ($Unem$) defined as a share ($w$) of wages ($W$) for unemployed workers ($unem = 1$) only.


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
T = \tau\sum Y_{hi}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
G = w\cdot W \cdot \sum unem = Unem \cdot \sum unem
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

There is no interest payment on government bills ($B$) for simplicity.
Government net lending necessity is defined as:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta B = G - T + r_{g}B_{t-1} = G - T
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


* Bank

In this version, there is no credit restriction.
Banks supply credit for both firms as demanded, so no mortgages.
For simplicity, the mark-up on policy rate is null ($r_{lf} = r_{mo} = r_{g}$).
Thus, there is no bank's net financial wealth ($NW_{b}$).

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
NW_{b} = r_{g}\cdot L_{fc,t-1} + r_{g}\cdot L_{fk, t-1} - r_{g}\cdot M_{h,t-1} = r_{g}\cdot (L_{fc,t-1} + L_{fc,t-1} - M_{h,t-1})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

* Firms (subscript $fi$)

Both firms produce using a Leontieff production function.
Employed workers are defined randonly and they receives a fixed and constant wage.

** Concrete producer sector

This sector is similar to a capital goods production sector since it provides inputs for the construction sector.
In order to produce concrete, this firms use Land ($Land$) and Labor ($Labor$).
Landowners receives land's rent.

*** Potential output ($Y_{full, fk}$)

In order to produce, firms use a Leontieff-type technology:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{full, fk} = \min (\kappa_{land,fk}\cdot Land, \kappa_{Labor, fk}\cdot Labor)
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
since land is an unproducible good:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{land,fk} < \kappa_{labor, fk}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

As a consequence, effective capacity utilization ratio ($u_{fk}$) is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
u_{fk} = \frac{Y_{fk}}{Y_{full,fk}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Production factors demand

*** Production plans ($Y_{fk}$)

*** Investment decisions ($I_{fk}$)

Concrete firms production follows effective demand principle.
Thus, this expenditure is fully induced by its expected demand ($Y^{De}_{fk}$).

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
I_{fk} = h_{fk}\cdot Y^{De}_{fk}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $h_{fk}$ is the marginal propensity to invest.
Expected demand is defined according to a adaptative expectation rule.

Concrete producer firms adapt its marginal propensity to invest based on divergences between current ($u_{fk}$) and normal ($\mu_{fk}$) capacity utilization ratio.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta h_{fk} = \gamma_{u,fk}\cdot(u_{fk} - \mu_{fk})\cdot h_{fk,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Pricing ($p_{conc}$)

Firms set prices applying a fixed mark-up ($\theta_{fk}$) over direct unit labor costs ($W\cdot\kappa_{labor, fk}$):
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
p_{conc} = (1+\theta_{fk})\cdot (W\cdot\kappa_{fk})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Credit demand ($L_{fk}$)

** Constructor sector

This sector is similar to a final goods production sector.
In order to produce houses, this firms use Land ($Land$), Labor ($Labor$) and Concrete ($Conc$)

*** Potential output

Firms uses a Leontieff technology and uses three production factors:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{full,fc} = \min (\kappa_{land, fc}\cdot Land, \kappa_{labor, fc}\cdot Labor, \kappa_{conc, fc}\cdot Conc)
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
since land is an unproducible good and there is no population growth, we assume:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{land,fc} < \kappa_{labor, fc} < \kappa_{conc, fc}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Production factors demand


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
N^{D}_{fc} = u_{fc}\cdot Y_{full,fc}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Production decisions


The supply of new houses ($Y_{fc}$) is a function of expected demand and a desired buffer-stock ratio:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y_{fc} = (1+\iota^{T})\cdot Y^{De}_{fc} - INV_{fc, t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $Y^{De}_{fc}$ is the expected demand for new houses defined as a sum of expected demand for new houses across classes:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y^{De} = Y^{De}_{hw} + Y^{De}_{hc} + Y^{De}_{hl}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
while demand expectations follow an standard adaptative heuristic rule based on a fixed adjustment parameter ($\sigma$):
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Y^{De}_{fi} = Y_{fi, t-1} + \sigma\cdot (Y^{De}_{fi,t-1 } - Y_{fi,t-1})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

House price increase follow unsold houses stock ($INV$):
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta p_{H}}{p_{H,t-1}} = -\nu_{3}\Delta INV
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
while unsold houses is defined as:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta INV = Y_{fc} - \Delta HD_{hw} - \Delta HD_{hc} - \Delta HD_{hl}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


*** Investment decisions ($I_{fc}$)

Constructor firms follows effective demand principle.
Thus, this expenditure is fully induced by its expected demand ($Y^{De}_{fc}$).

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
I_{fc} = h_{fc}\cdot Y^{De}_{fc}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $h_{fc}$ is the marginal propensity to invest.
Expected demand is defined according to a adaptative expectation rule.

Concrete producer firms adapt its marginal propensity to invest based on divergences between current ($u_{fc}$) and normal ($\mu_{fc}$) capacity utilization ratio.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta h_{fc} = \gamma_{u,fc}\cdot(u_{fc} - \mu_{fc})\cdot h_{fc,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Buffer stock reavaluation

*** Pricing ($p_{H}$)

Firms set prices applying a fixed mark-up ($\theta_{fc}$) over direct unit labor costs ($W\cdot\kappa_{labor, fc}$):
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
p_{H} = (1+\theta_{fc})\cdot (W\cdot\kappa_{fc})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

* Housing market

In this version, there is no distinction between houses.
Future versions of this model will try to introduce some distinctiveness based on land and houses heterogeinity.
House prices are equal in the begining of the simulation and defined as $\Pi$ times the wage value.
So, houses are available only for those households that have accumulated wealth or retained profits above that level.
There is no restriction on the number of houses holden for each household.

** Land

Land is a scarce and not producible good, so:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Land = \overline{Land}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

** Rents


House rents ($Rent_{house}$) are defined as a share ($\rho$) on previous house price ($p_{H}$) and is paid by households for landowners.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Rent_{house} = \rho \cdot p_{H,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex


** Asks

Only households with more than one house are allowed to sell it.
If a household decide to sell a house, will ask a price based on the previous house price:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
ask = (1+\theta_{ask})\cdot p_{H,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
the house will be sold if bided price is at lest equal to asked ($bid \geq ask$).


** Bids

A household decide to buy a house according to a random draw.
If so, will offer based on the previous house price.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
bid = (1+\theta_{bid})\cdot p_{H,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

** Actions

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
action  =
    \begin{cases}
    sell =
        \begin{cases}
           \text{sell} \,\,\, if \,\,bid \geq ask\\
            \text{exit market   otherwhise}
        \end{cases}\\
    buy =
        \begin{cases}
            \text{buy} \,\,\, if \,\,ask \leq bid \leq RI^{d}\\
            \text{exit market   otherwhise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex



** Initialization

For simplicity, all capitalists and landowners start with housing units while workers rent it.
Thus, the share of workers initially with houses ($\phi$) is set to null in the base model.
Households decides to sell houses based on a random draw if owns more than one house.
Initially, landowners have more houses than capitalists which owns more houses than workers.




* Aggregate defined variables

* Experiments

** Variable initial house prices

** Variable initial rent (share of house prices)

** Share of worker initially with houses

** Changes in unemployment benefits

** Variable wages

* Questions

- How capitalists and landwoners decide in which house to live in?
  + They move out to the most expensive one?
- Asks and bids imply demand x supply price adjustment mechanism?
- How to define lands prices? Constant?
  + Landowners should receive land rents from firms?
- Constructor sector buys land from concrete producer sector?
- Residential investment as a share of household wealth imply Say's law?
- How firms decide how to split labor demand?
  + Concrete producer sector demands first?
- Is necessary to define a demand for land?
- What is the difference between production and investment decisions? How to include them togheter?
- How buffer stock affects sraffian supermultiplier mechanism?
- How houses buffer stock affects price setting in constructor sector?
- What if a household is not abble to pay rents?
  + Government benefits equal to initial rent?
- Residential investment funded by accumulated wealth instead of mortgages inplies a black hole?
