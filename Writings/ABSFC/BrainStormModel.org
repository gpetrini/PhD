* Introduction


This document have the initial ideias for the Dissertation ABSFC model.

** Empirical motivation

- New narrative


** Theoretical background and further discussions

- Classical surplus approach: classes dispute for a share of surplus generated by housing bubble
- Following textcite:ge_2017_Endogenous, housing market have some distinctiveness compared to regular commodities markets:
  1. Highly leverage: Residential investment could be considered an non-capacity creating autonomous expenditure
  2. Closed link with financial markets: Houses as a collateral
  3. Heterogeinity of motives: Market with both speculative and non-speculative buyers
  4. "Thin Market": Number of transaction in a given period is low
  5. Spatial interaction: composed by a set of areas that interact with each other


Following textcite:kindleberger_2005_Manias, we can define a bubble as:
#+begin_quote
"A bubble is a sharp rise in asset price in a continuous process, with the initial rise generating expectations of further rises and attracting new buyers – generally speculators interested in proﬁt from trading in the asset rather than its use or earning capacity.
The rise is then followed by a reversal of expectations and a sharp decline in price, often resulting in severe ﬁnancial crisis in short, the bubble bursts."

* General Assumptions

The simplifying assumptions are the following and will be the same in all model's versions:

- Fixed labor force size
  + Unemployment rate is fixed and randomly defined in the initialization
- Closed economy and no migration between areas
  + Spatial lattice represents a whole country
- No technological change
- There is only one bank and one firm of each type
- No real estate agent
  + House price information freely available in the drawn region
- Lattice cell does not represent the area of the house or the firm
  + It represents only a "constructable point"
  + More expensive houses could be larger, but will be represent by a equally sized point
  + Movements between the map regions are neglectible and does not affect households decisions to buy a new house
- Four goods: Houses, consumption goods, capital and land
  + Consumption and capital goods are produced in the same area
  + Land is an unrreproductible good
  + Land is incrementally available but its size will remain the same
  + Only houses are different, other goods are indistinguishable
- No transaction costs


Open (and questionable) assumptions:
- Technological progress
  + Innovation could reduce the need for further land
- Firms types will be aggregates or agentized
- Banks assets affects its credit requeriments to supply credit
- Presents landscape as regions
- Households can bids according to affordable regions

* Initialization

- Define which households are unemployed
- House and land prices are randomly defined
- Initial household wage as a linear function of initial houses or rents
  + Prevents households with low income owning an expensive house

* Spatial Dimension

** Lattice example

Let assume a 6X6 lattice with random land and house prices as well as random houses positions (manually set).
After the initialization, both land and house prices will evolve (houses number /ceteris paribus/).
In the top righ case, land and house prices are evaluated equally, there is: new house/land prices is the mean of the $n$ nearest points centered on this specific point.
In the lower case, land and houses prices are updated separetely, which means that land prices is equal to the $l$ nearest lands centered on this specific point and the same is done for houses.

- Consumption goods firms are not credit constrained
- Investment is financed by, in order, retained profits, loans and equities
  + Decision will be based on *Capital Structure* literature

**** Labor Demand ($N^{WNCD}_{fcg}$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
N_{fcg, t}^{WNCD} = \frac{u_{fcg, t}}{\nu}\frac{K_{fcg, t}}{A_{fcg, t}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex



**** R&D ($RD$)

If enabled in LSD script, R&D expenditures is a linear function o lagged sales:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
RD = flag_{RD}\cdot(\gamma_{RD}\cdot S_{fcg, t-1})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
- $flag_{RD}$ is equals to one when R&D is enabled, zero c.c.
- $\gamma_{RD}$ describes the proportion of previous sales to R&D $(0 < \gamma_{RD} <<1)$


**** Expansion investment ($I^{FCG}$)


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
I_{fcg} = h_{fcg}\cdot Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta h_{fcg,t} = \rho_{fcg}(u_{fcg,t} - u_{N})\cdot h_{fcg, t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

**** Pricing ($p^{C}$)

Firms set a *fixed* mark-up pricing rule over direct unit labor costs:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
p^{C} = (1+\theta^{C})\frac{\overline w^{FCG}}{A}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*Attention:* If technical progress is activated, /mark-up/ can be *variable*

**** Total Wage Bill ($W^{FCG}$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
W^{FCG} = \sum_{i=1}^{N^{WNCD}}w_{i}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

**** Credit demand ($L^{FNCD}$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
L^{FNCD} = \max[0, I^{FCG} + W^{FCG} - D^{FGC}_{fgc, t-1}]
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $D^{FGC}$ are firms' deposits with banks.


*** Construction firm

There are $FCG (= 1)$ in the construction sector.

- Construction and house improvements takes time (fixed period)
- House prices evolves according to the $n$ nearest houses while unconstructed land price will evolve with $l$ nearest area
  + $n$ and $l$ could be the same
  + $l$ could include only available land
  + Houses improvements adds value to an existing house
    - Only houseowners are allowed to improve a house.
- Rents will follow house prices (fixed share)
- All bids higher than market price are successfull

**** Labor Demand

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
N_{fc, t}^{WCD} = \frac{u_{fc, t}}{\nu}\frac{K_{fc, t}}{A_{fc, t}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex



*** Capital goods production (not sure)

*** Next Steps

- Include more than one sector
- Allows for production firms to expand

** Banks

- There are three type of credit lines: production-related (to firms); consumption loans and mortgages
- Bank evaluates if concedes credit for a unit based on its creditworthness
  + House price increase improves households balance sheet
  + Landowners and firm owners are not credit constrained
  + Rentiers and workers households may declare default if its net worth is negative
- If a household declares default, its house becomes an asset of the banks
  + Banks offers these houses to rentiers
- Banks defines interest rates with an spread on policy rate
  + Prime borrowers have better credit conditions


*** Credit supply

The banking system evaluates households' applications for loans based on the expected present value of each households’ loan demand. The particular probability of default ($pr^{D}_{h}$), modelled using a logistic function, influences this estimation:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
pr_{h}^{D} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(\phi_{1}\frac{YD_{h}^{e}}{NW^{H}} - \phi_{2}\Lambda^{H}\right)}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which:
- $YD^{e}$ expected disposable income
- $NW^{H}$ household wealth
- $\Lambda^{H}$ household leverage defined as total debt to assets ratio

**** Default probability based on historical data

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
pr^{H}_{h} = \frac{\sum_{i\subset N_{LH}}I(client i went foreclosure)}{\sum_{i\subset N_{LH}}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $N_{LH}$ are the households that have loans contracts with the bank.


*** Mortgage contract and credit accessibility cite:ge_2017_Endogenous

Mortgage contract is composed by the following terms:
- Elebibility requiriments
  + Maximum debt-to-income ration ($MaxDTI$)
  + Minimum downpayment rate ($down$)
- Value of the loan ($L_{H}$)
- Loan maturity ($t_{L}$)
- Annual mortgage rate set buy the bank ($rm$)
- Associated property in region as a colateral of the loan


**** Eligibility requiriments

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
p^{H}_{h} - L_{H,h} = down\cdot p^{H}_{h} \leq S_{H,h}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{mpi_{H,h}}{Y_{H, h}} \equiv DTI_{h} \leq MaxDTI
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

in which $S_{H,h}$ is the saving of household $h$, $mpi$ is the monthly mortgage payment, $DTI$ is the debt-to-income ratio.

**** Outstanding loan

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
L_{H,h} =
\begin{cases}
(1-down)\cdot p^{H}_{t^{\star}} \,\, if\,\,t = t^{\star}\\
(1 + \frac{rm}{12})\cdot (L_{H, t-1} - mpi) \,\, if\,\,t^{\star} < t \leq t^{\star} + t_{M}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $t^{\star}$ is the period when the house is acquired and $t_{M}$ is loan mortgage total duration.

**** Mortgage payments


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
mpi =
\begin{cases}
\frac{\frac{rm}{12}\cdot L_{H,t}}{1-\left(\frac{rm}{12}\right)^{t_{M}}} \,\, if\,\, t^{\star} \leq t \leq t^{\star} + t_{M}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

**** Collateral rate ($co$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
co^{h}_{t} = \min(\frac{p^{H,h}}{L_{H,t}}, 1+rm_{h})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

** Government

- Collects taxes as a share of household income
- Expenditures: consumption goods and subsistence wage
- Defines interest rate


*** Expenditures ($G$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
G = \sigma\cdot Y + UN\cdot w_{sub}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Taxation ($T$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
T = \tau\cdot Y^{H}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Government Debt ($B$)

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta B = (G - T) + i\cdot B_{t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

*** Policy rate

Exogenous

*** Subsistence wage update


#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
w_{sub, t} = (1+\pi^{R} + \pi^{C})\cdot (w_{sub, t-1})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex



** Households

There is $H$ (fixed) households which are devided in the following classes:
- Workers: Households that do not speculate nor have neither land or firms' equities
- Land Owner: Households that owns unoccupied land and receives firms' rent
- Firms Owner: Households that owns firms' distributed profits (equities)
- Rentier: Households which main source of income is the results of speculation with land/houses or public debt


*** Specific assumptions


- Unemployed households recieves an subsistence wage
  + Surplus is defined as the excess of subsistence wage
  + Updates with consumption goods price index and rents inflation
- No distinction between family members and households:
  + If each household agent represents its whole family, there is no need to explicity specify a labor market mechanism
- Only worker household type pay rents. Other will already have a house
  + Share of each type of households are fixed
  + Households that already have a house can decide to: improve the existing house, but a new one or do nothing
  + Renters households can decide whether to move or buy a house
- There is unconstructed land owned by landowners capitalists
- The richer a household is, the more expensive the preferred house will be
  + Richers households searches for House/Land first
  + Non-speculative households prefer cheaper houses in the region subset
- Household's propensity to invest or to improve a house will be sthocasthic
- Rentiers households are allowed to sell houses
- Non speculative houseowners must sell their houses before bying a new one. If fails to find an affordable one, stay at a rental dwelling (REVIEW)
- Households search only a sample of the model landscape
  + Seach is time consumming
- There is a fixed probability of moving out if not financially burdend (review)
