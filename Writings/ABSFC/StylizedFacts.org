* General Stylized Facts

* GFC-related evidence

- House price increase was not restricted to the US (Hubbard and Mayer, 2009)

** US specific

- House prices varied enourmously (Hubbard and Mayer, 2009)
- Subprime lending is relevant almost only for the US, so it cannot explain much in other countries
- Housing boom is explained by relaxed credit and lower housing transaction costs (Favilukis et al., 2010)

* House price volatility

** House prices and Mortgage rates

- Declinining of interest rate is a common factor among those country with housing booms (Hubbard and Mayer, 2009)
  + Mechanism: reduces the costs of owning a house
  + Higher housing demand (Taylor, 2009) mainly in land-constrained markets (Himmelberg et. al, 2005)
- Financial liberalization provides relaxed credit constraints (Favilukis et al., 2010)
- Discensus: mortgage interest rate does not includes long-term reversions so lower interest rates explain house price inflation but not its decline (Glaeser et al. 2010)
