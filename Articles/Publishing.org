* ROPE webinar <2020-10-15 qui>

** Trying to submit a paper

- The most important thing is to find a proper journal
  - Where your paper belong most
  - Check your references' journals. This is a good way to find which journal to publish
  - Another way is to ask to editors
  - *OBS:* ROPE is a "generic" journal

** Paper length

It is all about of the number of pages of the issue.

- It is important to respect. Other case, it is difficult to adjust in formatting process
  - 85K words
- Graphs and tables is about 400 words
  - Be aware of how many tables and graphs
  - Try to change for black and white
    - Otherwise will delay the production of the article
  - Make sure that they are your own. Otherwise, you need a permission
    - If it is your own, be prepared to share the data
- Make sure mathematical elements are clear
  - *OBS:* ROPE is moving towards empirical papers, SFC and formalization

** Quality of english

- It is responsibility to the author that paper have good english
  - Send to proof reader (155 euros)
- Do make your paper to blabla (?) before get accepted
  - If english is bad, there some journals that still accept the manuscript

** References

- Make sure to get up-to-date references (most recent references)
  - Reviewer probably knows the literature and will point that out
- Do not pad your references

** Self plagiarizing 

- Some editors will consider as bad as self-plagiarizing
  - In the previous paper, the is what I said... and summarize
- If a paper was already published in another language, it will not be published in english

** Submission

- Make sure to submit in only *one* journal at time and wait for the answer
  - As a consequence, the authors are banned to the journals
    - And this happen to big names as well
  - Recant gets public and is really bad for the career
- Make sure to submit the final form
  - Take as much time is needed
- Make sure to make your paper is anonymous
  - "I mentioned before in other paper..."
    - During time, you will have friends and enemies and this will impact

** Introduction

This section is certainly the most important
- If the introduction is well written will be adequate to send proper peer reviews
  - Must say what paper will say

** Rereading yourself

- Make sure to be really self-critical
- Do not repeat yourself
  - Peers claim when a manuscript is repetitive

** Referring process

- It is not a perfect process
  - Some referee report are reject
    - To be fair to the authors
  - *OBS:* ROPE will have a form next year
- Normally, two bad reviews $\Rightarrow$ rejected
  - One good review and other bad $\Rightarrow$ some editors like because the paper will be quoted
    - Promotes a good dynamic/dialog $\Rightarrow$ good from the editor point of view
  - In some cases, send to a third review
- Revise and resubmit does not mean publication
  - You must answer every point raised by both referees. Otherwise, there is little change to get published
    - Editors will ask for a letter
    - It is not expect to agree with all points
    - Show that you dealt with criticism

** Editors' decision

It is the final word. Do not argue with the editor. Publishing is also about relationships. Do not get a reputation to be a difficult author.
- If the manuscript is rejected, use this reports anyway to make your paper better
  - It is common to some authors send the same manuscript as before
  - It might be send to a same referee in other journal
    - Do not change cosmetically (referee are committing time)
- Do not exithate to ask of paper production process, but other editors will get mad
  - Remember to be polite.
  - 7-10 weeks for peer-review in best case scenario
  - Tell in advance if you are in job market

** Last topics

- Always ask advise to the editor
  - Referee may be contradictory
  - The editor knows who are bad or good referees
- Get involved with the journal!
  - You may be asked to be invited to be member of editorial team
  - Send editor an e-mail with CV
  - Accept to review a paper
    - It does lead to other stuff
      - Editorial/associate team
      - It is good for the career

*** Questions

- When you know a paper is too country-specific?
  - It is a question of fit
  - These are difficult decision for the editor
  - If the topic is specific, it may no be adequate for the journal
    - It is more important than country-specific
- Working paper related
  - Should be published as a working paper before?
    - Most often, ROPE editor changes the title in order to the peer will not find
      - The same reason because send as a PDF file
      - Some editors use authmetrics (how many retweet and other stuff)
	- It is useful to apply for grants
  - *Hint:* Take them down
- How long to wait before submit to the same journal?
  - Some journals do not care about it (ROPE is one case)
