\begin{abstract}
This article investigates the relationship between residential investment, asset inflation, and macroeconomic dynamics based on
the US post-deregulation case (1992-2019). To do so, we estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) to asses the relevance of
real interest rate of real estate. We find residential investment growth rate and houses’ own interest rate to be cointegrated. We
also find that long-run causality goes unidirectionally from houses’ own interest rate to residential investment growth rate,
as expected. In summary, our findings support the relevance of houses’ own interest rate in determining residential investment
while the other way round does not occur.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org522b5cc}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Among aggregate demand expenditures, non-residential investment is the most examined  one between (at least) heterodox macroeconomists.
As a consequence, the relevance of others (autonomous) expenditures on macroeconomic dynamics has been underestimated \cite{brochier_macroeconomics_2017}.
The Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) model presented by \textcite{serrano_long_1995} establishes a prominent role for non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures in the theoretical ground.
Despite the late interest in those expenditures \cites{freitas_pattern_2013}{girardi_long-run_2016}{girardi_autonomous_2018}{braga_investment_2018}, there still is a lack of studies on the role of residential investment in particular.

Our main objective is to assess the determinants of residential investment growth rate.
We argue that the scarce attention that residential investment receives is not compatible with its relevance for the US and its significance is not restricted to the Great Recession.
In Section \ref{sec:Stylized_Facts}, we present some stylized facts for the US economy highlighting the relevance of residential investment.
Next, in Section \ref{sec:empirical_review}, we will present and compare different macroeconometric models that explicitly incorporate residential investment.
In Section \ref{sec:VECM}, we estimate a bi-dimensional vector error-correction model (VECM) using time-series data for the US economy from 1992 onward to test the houses' own interest rate presented by \textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015}. 
Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} offers some concluding remarks.
The results for all statistical tests are provided in Appendix \ref{appen:A}.



\section{Residential investment, economic growth and business cycle in the US economy}
\label{sec:org45e0550}
\label{sec:Stylized_Facts}
Before the subprime crisis and the subsequent Great Recession (GR, 2008-9), economists usually did not pay due attention to the role of residential investment to macroeconomic dynamics.
Perhaps, this lack of attention can be explained by the small share of residential investment on aggregate demand (see figure \ref{fig:share}).
Since the Global Financial Crisis, this landscape has changed, making clear the macroeconomic role of housing prices and finance, and residential investment.
Specifically, we argue however small its share on GDP is, it does have a fundamental role in explaining business cycles and long-run growth.

There are, nevertheless, two notable exceptions. In a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the mid of the Great Depression, Keynes present the case of housing as the best aid to fight the crisis and to foster economic recovery \cite[p.~436]{keynes_collected_1978}.
The other exception is \textcite{duesenberry_investment_1958} who presents a critique of ordinary theories of aggregate investment because they put together firms’ investment in capital and structures and investment in residential housing.
In this sense, he builds a model dedicated for the latter type of investment, emphasizing the role of house prices.

\end{figure}

Recently, more and more economists are paying attention to the relevance of residential investment for the business cycles.
\textcite{green_follow_1997} analyzed this connection even before the Great Recession.
Based on Granger causality tests for the US from 1952 to 1992, he concludes that residential investment leads the cycle, while non-residential investment (i.e., firms business investment) lags the cycle.
\textcite{green_follow_1997} relates this result to the forward-looking behavior of households.
Thus, he restricts the relevance of residential investment as a temporal precedence indicator.

\textcite{leamer_housing_2007} is more incisive and states that housing is the business cycle.
In analyzing the US economy for the post-war period, he concludes that residential investment is the best predictor of economic crises.
The economic cycle of US economy would be a consumer cycle: ``first homes, then cars, last business investment'' \cite[p.~8]{leamer_housing_2007}.
In a follow up work, the author declare that nine out of eleven US economic recessions were preceded by a severe downturn of residential investment, in the post-war period \cite{leamer_housing_2015}.

\textcite{kydland_2016_housing} extends \citeauthor*{leamer_housing_2007}'s \citeyear{leamer_housing_2007} proposition to other countries to evaluate how unique the US case is.
Similarly to \textcite{green_follow_1997}, they also conclude that residential investment leads the cycle -- while non-residential investment lags it -- for the US and Canada.
The results, however, are more robust when they include housing starts instead of residential investment.
Briefly, they find that housing starts precedes GDP the shorter the time to build is\footnote{For the other countries in the sample, \textcite{kydland_2016_housing} find that residential investment is coincident (and not lagging) with GDP. Additionally, they conclude that long-term nominal mortgage rate is a relevant transmission channel from interest rates to housing costs.}.
More recently, \textcite{huang_is_2018} assess  prediction and causality relations proposed by \textcite{leamer_housing_2007} for 17 OECD countries.
For the US both statements are valid\footnote{For the other countries, they found inconclusive results regarding fluctuations due to institutional heterogeneity. However, \textcite{huang_is_2018} claim that for most G7 countries, residential investment at least amplify the business cycle.} and housing related variables (house prices, real mortgage rate --- deflated by a consumer price index --- and bank spread) lead the business cycle.


In order to depict the relation between residential investment and business cycle, we present Figure \ref{fig:cycle}.
In each panel, we present the growth rate of selected expenditures two years before and after recession begin.
In most of them, residential investment growth rate is negative before the recession start.
The Great Recession is a remarkable example of this pattern while dot-com crisis (2000-1) is an exception as already pointed out by \textcite{leamer_housing_2007}.

\end{figure}


In a heterodox perspective, \textcites{fiebiger_semi-autonomous_2018}{fiebiger_trend_2017} present residential investment as a Luxemburg-type external market providing a source of autonomous demand to absorb economic surplus.
Both works state its role (together with debt-financed consumption) in inducing non-residential investment and driving output growth, during the business cycle as well in the long-run.
Figure \ref{fig:trend} presents the trend of GDP and residential investment growth rate by estimating a HP filter.
Both series share a correlation relation in which residential investment growth rate is more volatile than GDP growth rate.
Recently, \textcite{perez_Montiel_2021} find that residential investment leads both the business cycles and the long-run economic growth for the US economy.
Similar to \textcite{girardi_long-run_2016}, they do not report any relevant feedback from output to residential investment, configuring this expenditure as an autonomous one.

Before we move forward, it is worth mentioning that the relevance of housing is not restricted to its implications to growth and business cycles.
For example, \textcite{jorda_great_2016} report that credit and financial sector growth has been led mainly by mortgages. 
As a consequence, banking activities were redirected towards granting credit majorly to households and not towards productive investment \cites{erturk_banks_2007}{kohl_more_2018}.
Other studies have shown that real estate inflation is the main determinant of household indebtedness, distribution of wealth and that it has implications for macroeconomic stability \cites{ryoo_household_2015}{stockhammer_debt-driven_2016}{barnes_private_2016}{johnston_global_2017}{mian_household_2017}{anderson_politics_2020}{fuller_housing_2020}. 
In summary, what we intended to show was the macroeconomic relevance of residential investment.
On the following section, we analyze how econometric literature has dealt with determinants of the latter.
\section{Determinants of residential investment: review of empirical literature}
\label{sec:org57825d1}
\label{sec:empirical_review}
As we have seen in the previous session, there has been a growing attention to the macroeconomic implications of residential investment. It is worth noting, there is a vast empirical literature on housing. However, this literature is mainly focused on urban and regional economics or microeconomic issues. As a consequence, few econometric papers analyze housing in macroeconomic terms. Additionally, if housing macroeconomic literature is scarce, even fewer scholars examine residential investment and its determinants specifically. In this section, we review papers that analyse the determinants of residential investment (or some proxy) focusing on the US case, as well on some panel analysis of multiple countries.

In this sense, \citeauthor*{poterba_tax_1984}'s \citeyear{poterba_tax_1984} contribution stands out once it considers houses as an asset and not only as a durable consumption good.
Based on asset-market model for the construction sector, he calibrates a model for the US from 1974 to 1982 to simulate the effect of inflation and tax policy on house markets.
In order to specify a residential investment function, he includes real house prices, a non-residential constructor deflator index, wages of the housing sector and alternates between two measures  of  credit  rationing.
The empirical estimations shows that residential investment is positively induced house prices.

\textcite{topel_1988_Housing} come to a similar conclusion to \textcite{poterba_tax_1984}.
Based on instrumental variables, they estimate the determinants of housing starts (as a proxy for residential investment) for the US from 1963 to 183.
Their functional form for residential investment includes hedonic prices and some cost shifters for the construction sector such as interest rate, expected inflation, wages and median market time since the construction begins.
In summary, they found that residential investment is highly sensible to house prices movements while interest rate is a relevant cost shifter.

Recently,  \textcite{arestis_residential_2015} update \citeauthor*{poterba_tax_1984}'s \citeyear{poterba_tax_1984} framework by estimating an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for 17 OECD countries.
In their model, they specify residential investment as a positive function of house prices, real disposable income and bank credit while mortgage interest and unemployment rate are expected to have negative effects.
They report that disposable income is the major determinant of residential investment for most OECD countries while banking credit and house prices are more relevant for the US.

Some scholars estimated residential investment based on a Tobin's Q for residential investment\footnote{This adapted Tobin's Q is defined as the ratio between the market price of new houses and construction cost to build a new one.}.
\textcite{barot_2002_House}, for instance, investigate the differences and similarities for the Sweden and UK housing market based on a stock-flow framework from 1970 to 1998.
Their residential investment functional form includes both Tobin's Q for residential investment and real interest rate.
They report some opposite results regarding Granger causality tests for house prices, financial wealth, household debt and interest rate.
The only result that is equally valid for both Sweden and UK is that Tobin's Q for residential investment  granger causes housing investment.
More recently, \textcite{kohlscheen_2018_Residential}, also estimate residential investment as a function of this particular Tobin's Q with an unbalanced panel data for 15 OECD countries from 1970 ownwards\footnote{More precisely, \textcite{kohlscheen_2018_Residential} include Tobin's Q for residential investment numerator and denominator as separate variables.}.
Beyond this adapted Tobin's Q they also include real house prices, GDP level, population density, net migration rates and house stock share on GDP.
They conclude that real house prices growth, nominal interest rate, net migration rates and existing house stock are the main determinants of residential investment.

Other common ground in the housing literature is the relevance of interest rate for residential investment.
In a OLS model for 7 OECD countries, \textcite{egebo_1990_MODEL} concludes that real disposable income and interest rate deflated by consumer price index are relevant for explaining residential investment movements.
For the US in particular, they report that mortgage interest rate coefficients are robust.
Some scholars have reported that the residential investment sensitivity to interest rate are still valid after institutional changes of mid-1980s\footnote{The savings and loans crisis was followed by a set of institutional changes which affected the housing financial system. Just to name two of them: Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (1980); Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA, 1989). For a detailed chronology, see  \textcite[Appendix B]{mccarthyMonetaryPolicyTransmission2002} and \textcite{green_american_2005}; for a discussion on the consequences for households access to consumption and mortgage credit see \textcite{federal_deposit_insurance_corporation_savings_1997,wall_too_2010}.}.
\textcite{mccarthyMonetaryPolicyTransmission2002}, for instance, evaluate the responsiveness of residential investment to interest rates considering these changes in the housing financial system.
In order to isolate these effects, they estimate  a GMM model for the US in two sub-samples (1975-1985 and 1986-2000).
They conclude that the residential investment response magnitude to a monetary shock before and after these institutional breaks are similar.
\textcite{gauger_residential_2003} also evaluate the consequences of deregulation of depository institutions throughout the 1980s.
In order to do so, they estimate a VECM between a monetary aggregate (M2), GDP, residential investment and alternate between short-term government bonds and long-term mortgage interest rates.
They report an increasing contribution of long-term mortgages interest rate in order to explain resident investment variance after those institutional changes mentioned above.


Table \ref{tab:summary_models} shows an overview of the discussed topics and its main conclusions.
Each table entry contains the paper's sample, estimation method and its covariates.
In the next section, we purpose and estimate an alternative for the residential investment in the US.

\section{Macroeconometric analysis}
\label{sec:org31687c3}
\label{sec:VECM}
\subsection{Houses' own interest rate and residential investment growth rate in the US Economy}
\label{sec:org47b6c8e}
\label{sc:own}

From the previous review of the empirical literature, we conclude that may be the only consensus about the determinants of residential investment is on house prices (nominal or deflated by consumer price index) and some rate of interest (mortgage or long term, as proxy).
Some authors deflate the rate of interest by the CPI, others use nominal interest rate to capture the effect of monetary illusion.
In this section, we present a particular and parsimonious way of combining house prices and mortgage rate of interest in a single index that we will use on our econometric estimation.

Based on the recent US housing boom episode and its consequences, \textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015}  proposed the houses own rate of interest (\(own\)).
Inspired by \citeauthor*{sraffaDrHayekMoney1932} \citeyear*{sraffaDrHayekMoney1932} own commodity rate, this variable is the mortgage interest rate (\(r_{mo}\)) deflated by real estate inflation (\(\pi\)) as follows:
\begin{latex}
\begin{equation}
owm =  \overbrace{\left(\frac{1+r_{mo}}{1+\pi} - 1\right)}
\end{equation}
\end{latex}
In sum, this particular real interest rate is the most relevant for households since it is the real cost in real estate from buying real estate  \cite[p.~53]{teixeira_crescimento_2015}.

\textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015} also show that this simple procedure is relevant to describe residential investment growth rate (\(g_{I_{h}}\)).
Figure \ref{propria_investo} illustrates how this deflation procedure is more adequate than a general price index --- as
\textcite[p.~143--6]{fair_macroeconometric_2013} does --- to describe the residential investment dynamics.
Equation \ref{gihown} presents the negative relation between houses own rate of interest and residential investment in the simplest functional form as possible:
\begin{equation}
\label{gihown}
g_{I_h} = \phi_0 - \phi_1\cdot own
\end{equation}
where \(\phi_0\) stands for long-term determinants (\emph{e.g.} demographic factors, housing and credit policies, etc.) while \(\phi_1\) captures the demand for real estate arising from expectations of capital gains resulting from speculation with the existing dwellings stock.


\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{Residential investment growth rate vs. Houses Own interest rate}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/TxPropria_Investo.png}
	\caption*{\textbf{Source:} U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Authors' elaboration}
\end{figure}

Despite shedding light on some relevant relationships, \citeauthor*{teixeira_crescimento_2015}'s \citeyear{teixeira_crescimento_2015} proposition was not evaluated econometrically.
Before we move forward to the empirical estimations, it is worth noting that during a housing bubble period, it is real estate inflation that governs houses own rate of interest.
So, the lower this rate is, the greater the capital gains (in real estate) for speculating with real estate will be.


\subsection{Data and estimation strategy}
\label{sec:orgc14cd86}
\label{sec:estimation}


In this section, we estimate a model to test whether or not houses own rate of interest describes residential investment growth rate movements.
Our sample period (1992:Q1 to 2019:Q1) starts after institutional changes due to the Savings and Loans crisis (see Table \ref{structbreak} in appendix \ref{appen:A} for structural break tests)\footnote{This institutional changes --- notably Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) in 1989 and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act  (FDICIA) in 1991 --- increased the credit volume to households. As a consequence, real estate finance has increased considerably in the following periods.}
We rely on the following  quarterly seasonally adjusted data: (i) 30-Year fixed mortgage interest rate (MORTGAGE30US, resampled by end of period), private residential investment (PRFI, growth rate as percent change from the previous quarter) and Case-Shiller home price index
(CSUSHPISA, resampled by end of period).



Since we are interested in growth rate variables, we apply \textcite{yeo_new_2000} transformation procedure due to non-positive values.
Additionally, we consider mortgage interest rate as an exogenous variable in all tests and estimations.
Then, we employ standard unit root tests (see Table \ref{unitroot} in appendix \ref{appen:A}) as well as \textcite{johansen_estimation_1991} procedure to assess whether houses own rate of interest and residential investment growth rate share a common long-run trend (see Table \ref{Johansen} in appendix \ref{appen:A}).
We report a 5\% significance level which allows us to estimate a error correction model \cite{enders_applied_2014}.
To do so, we assume the following long-run relationship:

\begin{latex}
\begin{equation}
\label{gihLR}
g_{I_{h_{t}}} = \phi_{0} - \phi_{1}\cdot own_{t}
\end{equation}
\end{latex}
next, we specify the short-run adjustment process of Equation \ref{gihLR} as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta own_{t}\\
\Delta g_{I_{h_{t}}}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\delta_{1}\\\delta_{2}\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{1}\\ \alpha_{2}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}g_{I_{h_{t}}} - \phi_{0} + \phi_{1}\cdot own_{t}\\g_{I_{h_{t}}} - \phi_{0} + \phi_{1}\cdot own_{t}\end{bmatrix} + \sum^N_{i=1} \begin{bmatrix}\beta_{1,i} \Delta g_{I_{h_{t-i}}} & \gamma_{1,i} \Delta own_{t-i}\\\beta_{2,i} \Delta g_{I_{h_{t-i}}} & \gamma_{2,i} \Delta own_{t-1} \end{bmatrix} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}
where \(\delta_s\) indicate linear trend (level);
\(\alpha_{is}\) are the error correction coefficients;
\(\beta_s\) and \(\gamma_s\) are coefficients associated with lagged \(g_{I_h}\) and \(own\) respectively and; \(\varepsilon_s\) are the residuals.
Based on \textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015}, we depict the expected results in Table \ref{resultados_esperados} below:


\input{./tabs/hypothesis.tex}


The next step is to define the model order. According to usual information criteria, both first and forth lags are eligible (see Table \ref{criterios} in appendix \ref{appen:A}).
Although parsimonious, we argue that the first lag has no empirical support.
According to the Survey of Construction (Citar), the average construction time (from approaval to completion from 1976 to 2018) for a family unity for sale is approximately seven months.
Thus, we should include at least the second lag in order to incorporate homes built for capital gains purposes which only take place once the construction is completed.

DISCUSSÃO ECONÔMICA (LUCAS).
We argue that there is other economic intuition to explain the forth lag specification.
Residential investment (newly constructed homes) is significantly smaller than existing housing stock, we verify an price-effect even if the construction is unfinished\footnote{\textcite{poterba_tax_1984}, for instance, suggests that the time that houses takes to be sold should be include.}.
We argue that this price effect is a result of future real estate inflation.
Such dynamic could be captured by the \textbf{expected} houses' own interest rate.
However, such series does not exist.
So, we use lagged houses' own interest rate as a first approximation to the expected one\footnote{This procedure is similar to \textcite{keynes_general_1937} ``practical theory of the future'' in which decision-making process for buying a new property depends on expectations/conventions based on past observations.
In summary, in the absence of a series for the expected own interest rate, the lag of this variable will be used as a proxy for the future one.}.

\textbf{Lucas:} Este parágrafo descreve a figura que descartamos, mas imaginei que poderia aproveitar alguma coisa para discutir a autonomia da taxa própria em relação ao investimento residencial (aproveitei e mudei a nota de rodapé do Leamer para o corpo do texto).
In order to display the relation between lagged own interest rate and current residential investment growth rate, Figure \ref{defasagens} depicts one variable of interest against the other variable lagged according to lags that minimize the information criteria (1 and 4 respectively).
This simple procedure allows checking if there is any relationship between the expected own interest rate (in this case, lagged effective rate) and residential investment growth rate.
In the same Figure, we verify the non-occurrence of the inverse relationship from residential investment to own interest rate.
Since residential investment (flow) is much lower than the existing stock of dwellings, it is expected that such relationship does not exist.
In summary, speculation with the dwellings stock generates inflation of these assets, which affects the construction of new houses (flow) and not the other way round.
It is worth noting a particular aspect of house price formation: land scarcity. As a consequence, speculation with residences is, in the end, speculation with land (the only scarce resource involved in its production) and, therefore, it is relevant for speculation with the dwellings stock \cite[p.~349]{leamer_housing_2007}.


Considering this theoretical and econometric discussion of model order specification, we estimate a four lag VEC  (see Table \ref{Estimacao}).
In addition to being theoretically based, this lag order also generates homoscedastic residuals without serial auto-correlation (see Table \ref{testes_resduos} in Appendix \ref{appen:A}).
Table \ref{testes_resduos} in Appendix \ref{appen:A} presents residual tests to check the model's specification while Table \ref{tab:robust} presents some robustness check.
On the following subsection, we analyze the results and compare with the theoretical expected ones presented in Table \ref{resultados_esperados} above.  




\subsection{Estimation results}
\label{sec:org1d500cf}
\label{sec:results}

According to parameters presented in Table \ref{Estimacao}, we find statistically significant co-integration  coefficients for both equations. 
Therefore, both variables share a (negative) long-run trend (validating hypotheses 1 and 4).
The short-term relationship between \(own\) and \(g_{Ih}\) (\(\beta_{1, is}\) coefficients) are not statistically significant at 5\%\footnote{The expected result (7) can also be validated from the inspection of Table \ref{Estimacao} in which only the fourth lag of own interest rate equation is statistically significant.}.
In addition, coefficients \(\gamma_{2,s}\) are negative and statistically significant at 5\%, supporting hypothesis 6 (see Table  \ref{Estimacao}).
We also find statistically significant coefficients related to demand for houses for non-speculative reasons (\(\phi_0\)), validating proposition 5.
On the other hand, the error correction parameter is statistically significant only for the residential investment growth rate equation.
In this sense, \(own\) is weakly exogenous compared to \(g_{I_h}\) while houses own rate of interest Granger-causes \(g_{I_h}\), supporting the hypothesis (2) and (3).
In conclusion, our estimation results are in line with the hypothesis presented above and can be summarized as follows: houses own rate of interest determines --- but is not determined by --- residential investment growth rate and these variables present a negative long-term relationship (are co-integrated).

DISCUSSÃO DO COEFICIENTE DE COINTEGRAÇÃO

Figure \ref{fevd} display the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) which reports houses own rate of interest in describing residential investment growth rate dynamics\footnote{It is important to note that the number of variables (two) used generates similar  of a Structural VEC, which means that Choleski's decomposition is sufficient to analyze the (orthogonalized) impulse response function.}.
We report that houses own rage of interest has  depicted  \(g_{Ih}\) --- while the reverse is not valid --- after the first quarter.
In addition, we find that such contribution is greater than 50\% beyond the third quarter (dashed line in Figure \ref{fevd}).
Therefore, houses own rate of interest is explained mainly by itself and explains \(g_{I_h}\) considerably.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Next, we analyze the orthogonilized impulse response function (Figure \ref{irf}).
We report a stable system since the increase in \(g_{I_h}\) on itself are dampened over time while equivalent shock on own interest rate has a non-explosive permanent effect.
On the other hand, an increase in \(g_{I_h}\) has a null effect over \(own\).
The most relevant result reported in Figure \ref{irf} is the considerable and lasting negative effect due to an increase in own interest rate over \(g_{I_h}\), validating \citeauthor*{teixeira_crescimento_2015}'s \citeyear{teixeira_crescimento_2015} proposition.

Next,  we contrast our findings with those obtained by the literature.
At this stage, we restrict the comparison with  \textcite{gauger_residential_2003} and \textcite{arestis_residential_2015} since both of them analizy residential investment determinants in a comparable timespan.
Similar to \textcite{gauger_residential_2003}, we report that mortgage interest rate is relevant for residential investment.
Our estimations are also in line with \textcite{arestis_residential_2015} (at least for the US).
However, they report statistically insignificant coefficients for mortgages nominal interest rate which is at odds with our conclusions.
In summary, our estimation reports that houses own rate of interest has a prominent role in describing residential investment growth rate movements.
Finally, it is worth noting that despite the amplitude of VEC order, our model is parsimonious considering the number of variables used.
Thus, we conclude that our estimation depicts residential investment growth rate satisfactorily.
On the following section we present some concluding remarks.

\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:org74671e1}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this article, we present a residential investment growth rate specification compatible with the Srrafian supermultiplier model.
To do so, we estimate a bi-dimension VEC evaluate \textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015}
proposal. 
We report: 
	(i) Houses' own interest rate (\(own\)) and residential investment growth rate (\(g_{I_h}\)) share a common long-run trend;
	(ii) \(g_{I_h}\) effects over \(own\) are negligible and; 
	(iii) own interest rate has a negative effect on \(g_{I_h}\) and is its main determinant (see Figure \ref{fevd}).
Besides being parsimonious, our estimations does not show residuals serial autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Thus, our results are quite satisfactory.

It remains to contrast our findings with those obtained by \textcite{arestis_residential_2015}.
It worth remembering that one of the authors' hypotheses is that residential investment depends on disposable income (is induced expenditure).
However, the authors themselves find that such results are not statistically significant for the US. Therefore, we can compare this result with our model.
Despite the differences, some results of the model are in line with those of \textcite{arestis_residential_2015}.
Among them, house prices relevance in determining residential investment dynamics for the US.
However, they report insignificant coefficients for mortgages nominal interest rate, that is, the opposite conclusion of our model.

In conclusion,  we report lack of work analyzing residential investment in a Sraffian supermultiplier-friendly framework in the macroeconometric literature.
Our estimation supports houses' own interest rate relevance in describing residential investment growth rate for the US as depicted by \textcite{teixeira_crescimento_2015}.
Thus, our  proposal differs from the usual empirical literature by:
	(i) considering housing as a non-capacity creating autonomous expenditure;
	(ii) reporting that mortgage interest rates are relevant to describe long-run residential investment dynamics; and notably 
	(iii) including asset bubble through houses own interest rate.

\section{Statistical Appendix}
\label{sec:org4ccaae8}
\label{appen:A}

In this appendix we report several tests: unit root tests on our variables of interest, Structural break test, Johansen procedure and hypothesis tests on residuals. 
The time-series of residential investment growth rate, mortgage interest rate and real estate inflation are all taken using \textcite{yeo_new_2000} transformation (see Figure \ref{YeoJhonson}).
As shown in Table \ref{unitroot}, the null hypothesis of a unit root in the first differences of the series is overwhelmingly rejected.
As mentioned, we found structural breaks related to institutional changes and our series are co-integrated (see Tables \ref{structbreak} and \ref{Johansen}).
Our estimation order selection was based both on statistical and theoretical reasoning with homoscedasticity residuals (see Tables \ref{criterios} and \ref{testes_resduos}).
All expected results are statistically significant and most of them are not restrict to model specification (see Table \ref{tab:robust}).
