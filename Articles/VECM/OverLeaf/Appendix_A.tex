\section{Statistical Appendix}\label{appen:A}

In this appendix we report several tests: unit root tests on our variables of interest, Structural break test, Johansen procedure and hypothesis tests on residuals. 
The time-series of residential investment growth rate, mortgage interest rate and real estate inflation are all taken using \textcite{yeo_new_2000} transformation.  
As shown in Table \ref{unitroot}, the null hypothesis of a unit root in the first differences of the series is overwhelmingly rejected.
As mentioned, we found structural breaks related to institutional changes and our series are co-integrated (see Tables \ref{structbreak} and \ref{Johansen}).
Our estimation order selection was based both on statistical and theoretical reasoning with homoscedasticity residuals (see Tables \ref{criterios} and \ref{testes_resduos}).
All expected results are statistically significant and most of them are not restrict to model specification (see Table \ref{tab:robust}).
