This article investigates the relationship between residential investment, asset inflation, and macroeconomic dynamics based on
the US post-deregulation case (1992-2019). To do so, we estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) to asses the relevance of
real interest rate of real estate. We find residential investment growth rate and houses’ own interest rate to be cointegrated. We
also find that that long-run causality goes unidirectionally from houses’ own interest rate to residential investment growth rate,
as expected. In summary, our findings support the relevance of houses’ own interest rate in determining residential investment
while the other way round does not occur.
