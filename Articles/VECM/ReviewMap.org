** Specific comments

Residential investment function is estimated as follows:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
RHI = RHI(GPD(+), INT (-), LAND(-))
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
The authors report the expected sign in their estimations.
LAND is computed using dwellings price and the deflator of residential investment.

| *Background*                                  | Residential investment volatility reduction is related to the deregulation in the housing finance system in the mid-1980s. As a consequence, mortgage markets are more connected to capital markets.                                        |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Purpose*                                     | Investigate whether or not the monetary transmission mechanism channels have changed with these institutional breaks.                                                                                                                       |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Relevance*                                   | This paper emphases the relevance of some institutional breaks for future empirical investigations.                                                                                                                                         |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | The authors estimates both reduced and structural models to evaluate the response of housing market to a monetary policy shock. Estimation using GMM method.                                                                                |
| *Results*                                     | The *magnitude* of the response to shock is similar to before the institutional break. The main difference is the *timming* of the response in which the housing market response is slower than before and more similar to the overall economy. |
| *Sample*                                      | US: 1975-1985 and 1986-2000                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Quantitative financing constraint (?) has a smaller influence than before while pricing has become the rationaing mechanism.                                                                                                                |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

- $cc_{t}$ construction cost index

Equitlibrium condition:

Residential investment equation

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\Delta \frac{I}{H} = \lambda_{s} (p_{t-1} - p^{s}_{{t-1}}) + \theta_{0} + \theta_{1}\Delta p_{t} + \theta_{2} cc_{t} + \theta_{3} r + \theta_{4} \Delta p_{t}^{l} + \theta_{5} q_{t-1} + v_{t}

** Theoretical considerations
The augmented Tobin model of housing investment incorporating the interest rate can be written as:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
q = \frac{PH}{PB}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{IH}{H} = h (q(+), r(-))
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
H^{S} = IH + (1-\delta)H_{t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
- $PH$ Market price
- $PB$ Construction price
- $r$ real interest rate (?)
- $\delta$ depreciation

In long-equilibrium, the value of Tobin’s q converges to 1

| *Background*                                  | Heterogenous recovery after the great financial crisis. Residential investment plays a prominent role on the recovery. This justify the relevance of this paper.  Most research on Housing has been analyzing house prices and not its volume. Household behavior change: house as a durable good $\Rightarrow$ asset                                                                                                                                  |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Residential investiment usually leads the economic recovery. Both house prices and construction section still at pre-GFC levels. In the short-run, housing is constrained by its supply. As a consequence, increasing demand press housing prices while it supply becomes gradually more elastic. Quantitative equilibrium adjustments. Housing is considered a speculative asset. ARDL method assumes that all variables are endogenously determined. |

| *Variables*                                   | Explained: Real house price growth ($h^{p}$) and short-term interest rates. Explanatory: real GDP growth ($y$); total employment growth ($l$, proxy for labor market and demographics factors); interest rate variables.  Growth of the domestic bank credit to the non-financial private sector was also initially included, but was eventually dropped because of its high correlation with real GDP growth. They include both real and nominal interest rate since the latter is a important lending criteria. |

| *Results*                                     | Short-term interest rate is the main determinant of house prices, specially outside the US. Demand for houses adjusts slowly to changes in interest rates due to high transaction costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

** US specific results

- Changes in US house prices are highly persistent
- Most lags enter the regression with a positive sign
  + Evidance against random walk model
- GDP and total employment seems to not affect house prices
- Both nominal and real interest rate affects the house price inflation
- House prices respond to long-term interest rate
- A 100 basis-point fall in the nominal US short-term rate generates a rise in real house prices

| *Background*                                  | Credit aggregates and asset prices play no role in standard models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | The must be multidirectional links between house prices and monetary variables. According to lifecycle mode, an increase in house prices leads to an increase in consumption. When house prices increases, residential investment Tobin's $q$ increase as well. So, residential investment is a positive function of house prices. House prices assumed to be sticker than monetary variables. Financial, structural e institutional changes in the 80s are supposed to  change the macroeconomic dynamics. |
| *Purpose*                                     | To investigate whether money, credit, house prices and GDP have multidirectional links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Links credit and asset prices in both directions and connects house prices with monetary variables (/i.e./ money, credit, house prices and economy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Housing booms are included with dummy variables. *Estimation:* OLS without time dummies. This specification is employed because $T>N$, so dummies would involve loss in efficiency. For Cholesky decomposition, ordering was based on monetary transmission literature.                                                                                                                                                              |

Stronger monetary shocks in housing boom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Monetary variables affects future house prices and the other way around also occurs. Only money growth affects future CPI. CPI shock capture supply-side disturbances ($\Uparrow cpi,\, \Downarrow y, \Uparrow ir, \Downarrow hp, \Downarrow m, \Downarrow c$) An house price shock increase all other variables. The same holds for money and credit shock. Money  and credit growth provides information about emerging house price booms or bubbles.                                                     |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | The authors themselves indicates that results are not statiscally significants. Housing boom included with dummy variables. Residential investment variable not included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| *5SS*                                         | The authors estimate a time-series fixed effects panel data for 17 industrialized countries for 1970-2006. They report a multidirectional relation between money, credit, house prices and GDP growth. This effects are stronger during housing booms.                                                                 However, they do not include residential investment.                                                                                                                                 |


** Main model

$$
Y_{i,t} = A_i + A(L)Y_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

- $Y$ endogenous variables
  - Variables: real GDP ($y$), consumer price index ($cpi$), short-term nominal interest rate ($ir$), nominal house prices ($hp$), nominal broad money ($m$) and nominal bank credit ($c$)
- $A$ country-specific fixed effects
  - Countries:  US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Australia

** Housing boom estimation

$$
Y_{i,t} = A_i + A_{NB}(L)Y_{i,t}\cdot D^{NB}_{i,t} + A_{B}(L)Y_{i,t}\cdot D^{B}_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

in which $B$ and $NB$ stands for boom and not housing boom respectively. Housing boom defined as follows (p. 24):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
persistent deviation of real house prices from a smooth trend, calculated based on a one-sided HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 100,000. A boom is defined as a positive deviation of house prices from this smooth trend of more than 5% lasting at least 12 quarters.
#+END_QUOTE


Next, another model is estimated whith $D^{NB}$ equals to one for those countries with lower real house price increases and zero otherwise and the same procedure was repeated for $D^B$. The same results were found: monetary variables have stronger effects during housing boom despite not being statistically significant.

Then, the author moves towards country-specific factors based on available LTV (loan-to-Value) ratio. They find countries with higher LTV to be the ones with higher price increases (relatively). However, the is no perfect correlation between this variables.

Quoting in defense of TsPanel (p. 15) based on Gavin and Theodorou
(2005):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
adopting a panel approach in a macro framework like our own
helps to uncover common dynamic relationships which might otherwise be obscured by idiosyncratic effects at the individual country level

| *Background*                                  |                                                                   |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            |This paper is highly based on "dynamic monetized production economy" which means that production requires credit to occurs. It is supposed that an increase on house prices would lead to a decrease on demand for credit (which is at odd with some stylized facts). |
| *Purpose*                                     | Evaluates if banking credit is determined by house prices.        |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Bank credit is endogenised through real estate-related variables. |
| *Relevance*                                   | This paper assumes some different hypothesis than those utilized in the dissertation. Addionaly, it analyses some similar countries. The dataset, though, is not so comparable.  Results are at odds with the empirical literature for the US |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 |The theoretical model assumes two types of firms: real-estate and non-real estate producers. Demand for Houses depends on disposable income ($RDY$), mortgage rate ($MR$) and housing prices ($P_H$). House supply, on the other side, depends positively on house prices and on real residential investment ($RRI$). Cointegration and error correction techniques |
| *Countries*                                   |9 OECD countries: Belgium, Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain and the United States.                                                |
| *Time range*                                  | 1970 to 2011 (restricted by availability)                         |
| *Results*                                     |There is a direct relationship between house prices and credit volume (but not at the US). For the US, Belgium and Norway, RDY is the only variable that describes credit volume. For the short-run dynamics, MR is not statiscally significant for any country while RDY is the only one for the US (which has the lowest $R^2$). Anyway, house prices has a positive effect on volume of credit in almost every country analyzed. |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      |                                                                   |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* |The authors implicitly suppose that there is no speculative reason for buy a House. Additionally, they suppose and price-adjustment mechanism. The authors describe a loop in housing-credit relation in which an increase in credit demand leads to an increase on house prices since its supply is fixed on the short-run. Real disposable income is include as a proxy for borrower risk of default. However, the following rationale is based on information criteria and other supply-side elements, which could be inconsistent with overall assumptions. Further, is mentioned that RDY is supposed to be the main determinant of house demand (and not credit). It is said that mortgage interest rate could crowd out construction investment. |

$$
D_H = D_H (\underset{-}{P_H}, \underset{+}{RDY}, \underset{-}{MR})

$$

on equilibrium

$$
P_H = P_H (\underset{+}{RDY}, \underset{-}{MR}, \underset{-}{RRI})
$$

$$
Q_H = Q_H (\underset{+}{P_H}, \underset{+}{RDY}, \underset{-}{MR})
$$

Next, they present an equation for Demand for Credit which depends on house market equilibrium

$$
D_C = D_C (\underset{+}{P_H(\cdot)}, \underset{+}{Q_H(\cdot)})
$$

$$
D_C = D_C (\underset{+}{P_H}, \underset{+}{RDY}, \underset{+}{RRI}, \underset{-}{MR},)
$$
while supply of credit depends only on mortgage rate (as a proxy for user cost of dwellings)

$$
S_C = S_C (MR)
$$
which implies the following Banking Credit (volume) equilibrium

$$
BC = BC (\underset{+}{P_H}, \underset{+}{RDY},\underset{+}{RRI},\underset{-}{MR})
$$

thus, the equation to be estimated is

$$
BC = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 P_H + \gamma_2 RDY + \gamma_3 + RRI - \gamma_4 MR
$$
where credit share to GDP was used as endogenous variable. Additionally, long-term interest rate was used instead of mortgage interest rate due to homogeneous and reliable information.

| *Background*                                  | Firm-centric Comparative Political Economy (CPE) approach stablishes that macroeconomic growth is determined by competitiveness gains. More recently, there is a macroeconomic turn to consumption-related variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Mortgage provision is one of the principal drivers of growth in the financial sector. House price increases is related to household endebtedness in advanced economies. Household indebtedness has a positive short-term effect on growth but a negative one on the long-run                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Purpose*                                     | The authors argue that CPE does not consider the financial sector sufficiently, mainly regarding household indebtednes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Additionally, evaluate whether household indebtedness and house prices affects each other in *both* directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Relevance*                                   | Analyze almost all the countries intended for the dissertation in a similar time range. So, it is an important paper for comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Three sets of equations: debt (households and business) on GDP growth; households debt as a function of house prices and GDP and; house prices as a function o household indebtedness and GDP. Specification tested: ARDL with robust panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE); mean group (MG) estimator to evaluate the *consistency* of the parameter (more robust in case of country heterogeneity) and two ADL model to examine the VoC subcategories using median value for each country of the stock market value traded to GDP ratio divided by the bank credit to GDP                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Time range*                                  | 1980 to 2017. The starting point was chosen to be related with the re-rise of financial sector  (see Bengtsson and Rynes 2015).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Countries*                                   | 18 advanced countries in an  unbalanced pooled panel data:  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. *Market-based banking economies:*  Switzerland, USA, Canada, Spain, Netherlands, Japan, UK, Sweden and Australia. *Less MB:* Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and New Zealand. *LMEs:* Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. *CMEs:* Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. *MMEs:* France, Italy and Spain. Countries without hight house inflation:  Germany, Italy and Japan. |
| *Results*                                     | Household debt has _stronger_ and more statistically significant effects on GDP than business debt. Changes in household debt volumes are largely a result of _house price fluctuations_. Macroeconomic effects of household debt and house prices are present across the cases in the sample and are _not limited to the Anglosphere countries_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | The author proposes an classification criteria for more or less marked-based economy based on Beck et al. (2009).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | Do not include residential investiment variable nor its specification. Since residential investment is not included, there is no reason for house prices affects GDP growth rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| *Background*                                  | Boom and burst in credit markets (industrialized countries). Credit usually plays no significant role on conventional models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Some authors have proposed to analyze credit differently from bonds and a other debt instruments (/i.e./ relaxing perfect substitutability of loans) and rise a different role of credit. *Financial accelerator model:* Both firms and households are borrowing constrained and can only borrow if they offer *collateral*. Borrowing capacity is supposed to be *procyclical* since Net Worth is procyclical as well. *Lifecycle model* supports the mechanism from property prices increase and expenditure increase. However, this effect is not true for renters. So, the general effect is mixed. The author also argues that property prices affect bank capital value directly (own assets) and indirectly (value of loans secured by property). |

| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Banking credit as a function of economic activity, interest rates and property prices for 16 industrialized countries (1980 onwards). *Estimation procedure:* VEC for each country. Interest rates are supposed to have a negative effect on credit demand (financing cost). Data are taken from BIS database. Aggregate property price is defined as average of residential and commercial property prices and are deflated by consumer price index. Countrywide residential prices are available for some countries only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Results*                                     | Finds a positive long-run relationships between  real credit, real GDP and real property prices and negative to real interest rate. Property prices are important determinant of long-run borrowing capacity to the private sector. Increases in property prices implies a positive effect on bank lending in most countries (IRF).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
