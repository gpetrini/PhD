In this article, we present a parsimonious specification for residential investment growth rate based on houses own-rate of interest proposed by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015.
Considering this index, we estimate a bi-variate VEC model for the US economy from 1992 to 2019.
We base the sample and lag order selection both on econometric and economic criterias.
Our results are:
	(i) Houses own-rate of interest ($own$) and residential investment growth rate ($g_{I_h}$) share a common long-run trend;
	(ii) $g_{I_h}$ effects over $own$ are negligible and; 
	(iii) houses own-rate of interest has a negative effect on $g_{I_h}$ and it is its main determinant.
Our estimations does not show residuals serial autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.
Additionally, the results are not sensible to lag order specification and most expected results remain valid in a economically relevant time horizon.

This paper is just a step towards an broad and emerging heterodox macroeconomic housing agenda.
A better comprehension of the connection between housing financial system and mortgage market institutional particularities could enlighten this discussion.
Further studies could also evaluate whether or not houses own-rate of interest validity is restricted to the US.
