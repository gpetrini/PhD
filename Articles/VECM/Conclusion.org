In this article, we present a parsimonious specification for residential investment growth rate based on houses own-rate of interest proposed by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015.
Considering this index, we estimate a bi-variate VEC model for the US economy from 1992 to 2019.
We base the sample and lag order selection both on econometric and economic criterias.
Our results are:
	(i) houses own-rate of interest ($own$) and residential investment growth rate ($g_{I_h}$) share a common long-run trend;
	(ii) $g_{I_h}$ effects over $own$ are negligible and; 
	(iii) houses own-rate of interest has a negative effect on $g_{I_h}$ and it is its main determinant.
Our estimations does not show residuals serial autocorrelation nor heteroscedasticity.
Additionally, the results are not sensible to lag order specification and most expected results remain valid in a economically relevant time horizon.

In summary, our results contributes to a better understanding on the financial determinants of residential investment.
The proposed index clarify the connection between asset price inflation (in this case house prices) and aggregate demand through residential investment, extending textcite:petrini_2021_TD and textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015 works to an empirical direction.
From a policy making perspective, our findings highlight the relevance to go beyond LTV cap recommendations and analyse how house prices, credit grant, residential investment e economic performance are related.
In other words, macroeconomic models that does not explicitly include residential investment and its determinants may capture just one part of the story.

This paper is just a step towards an broad and emerging macroeconomic housing agenda.
Further studies could evaluate whether or not houses own-rate of interest validity is restricted to the US economy.
A better comprehension of the connection between housing financial system and mortgage market institutional particularities could also enlighten this discussion.
