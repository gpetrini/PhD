In this article, we presented a simple specification for residential investment growth rate based on houses own-rate of interest proposed by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015.
Considering this index, we estimated a bi-variate VEC model for the US economy from 1992 to 2019.
We based the sample and lag order selection both on econometric and economic criteria.
Our results are:
	(i) houses own-rate of interest ($own$) and residential investment growth rate ($g_{I_h}$) share a common long-run trend;
	(ii) residential investment growth rate effects over $own$ are negligible; and
	(iii) houses own-rate of interest has a negative effect on residential investment growth rate and it explains more than a half of its variance after the second quarter.
Our estimations do not show residuals serial autocorrelation nor heteroscedasticity.
Additionally, most of the results hold for different lag specification.

In summary, our results contributes to a better understanding of the financial determinants of residential investment.
The proposed index is a parsimonious way to relate asset inflation with aggregate demand.
In this particular case, house prices and residential investment, extending textcite:petrini_2021_TD and textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015 works to an empirical direction.
From a policy making perspective, our findings highlight the relevance to go beyond LTV cap recommendations and analyze how house prices, credit grant, residential investment and economic performance are related.
In other words, macroeconomic models that do not explicitly include residential investment and its determinants may capture just one part of the story.

This paper is just a step towards an broad and emerging macroeconomic housing agenda.
Further studies could evaluate whether houses own-rate of interest validity is restricted to the US economy.
A better comprehension of the connection between housing financial system and mortgage market institutional particularities could also enlighten this discussion.
