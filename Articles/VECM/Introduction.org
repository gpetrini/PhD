The Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) model presented by textcite:serrano_long_1995 establishes a prominent role for non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures in the theoretical ground.
A current trend among empirical research on demand-led growth agenda is to test its  relevance and stability. 
textcite:freitas_pattern_2013 present a growth accounting decomposition and show the relevance of those expenditures to describe the Brazilian GDP growth rate between 1970-2005. 
textcite:braga_investment_2018 shows evidence that economic growth and induced investment are governed by unproductive expenditures in Brazilian economy from 1962 to 2015. 
For the US, textcite:girardi_long-run_2016 show that autonomous expenditures do cause long-run effects on the growth rate. textcite:girardi_autonomous_2018 bring evidence that autonomous expenditures determine the investment share on GDP for twenty OECD countries. 
textcite:haluska_growth_2019 employ Granger-causality tests to assess the stability of the SSM for the US (1987-2017). They find: (i) causality goes from autonomous expenditures to the marginal propensity to invest; (ii) induced investment share has a higher temporal persistence and presents slow and statistically significant adjustment rate to demand growth, as described by the SSM.


Nevertheless, there still is a lack of studies on the role of residential investment in particular. 
Except for textcite:green_follow_1997 and textcite:leamer_housing_2007 --- which shows the relevance of this expenditure to US business cycle at least since the post-war period ---, most of those studies were published after the Great Recession (2008-2009)[fn::More precisely, \textcite[p.~8]{leamer_housing_2007} argues that the US business cycles can be characterized as follows: ``/first homes, then cars, and last business equipment/''.].
Our main objective is to assess the determinants of residential investment growth rate in a Sraffian supermultiplier-friendly framework as proposed by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015.
In Section ref:sec:Stylized_Facts, we present some stylized facts for the US economy highlighting the relevance of residential investment.
Next, in Section ref:sec:empirical_review, we will present and compare different macroeconometric models that explicitly incorporate residential investment.
In Section ref:sec:VECM, we estimate a bi-dimensional vector error-correction model (VECM) using time-series data for the US economy from 1992 onward to test the houses' own interest rate presented by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015. 
Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} offers some concluding remarks.


We find residential investment growth rate and houses' own interest rate  to be cointegrated. We also find that that long-run causality goes unidirectionally from
houses' own interest rate to residential investment growth rate, as expected.  The results for all tests are
provided in Appendix ref:appen:A.
In summary, the findings provided in Section ref:sec:VECM appear to support the relevance of houses' own interest rate in determining residential investment while the other way round does not occur.
