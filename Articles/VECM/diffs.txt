 \label{sec:Introduction}
 The importance of non-residential investment for economic growth is a commonplace among heterodox economists.
 As a consequence, the relevance of others expenditures on macroeconomic dynamics has been underestimated \cite{brochier_macroeconomics_2017}.
 After the subprime crisis (2008) and the Great Recession (2008-2009) this landscape has changed.
-More recently, other expenditures have been scrutinized under the demand-led growth agenda \cites{freitas_pattern_2013}{girardi_long-run_2016}{girardi_autonomous_2018}{braga_investment_2018}.
-However, few studies focus on the role of residential investment in particular \cite{petrini_2021_TD}.
+The Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) model presented by \textcite{serrano_long_1995} establishes a prominent role for non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures in the theoretical ground.
+More recently, those expenditures have been scrutinized under the demand-led growth agenda \cites{freitas_pattern_2013}{girardi_long-run_2016}{girardi_autonomous_2018}{braga_investment_2018}.
+However, few studies focus on financial determinants of the autonomous expenditures or on the role of residential investment in particular \cites{petrini_2021_TD}{brochier_supermultiplier_2018}.
+This paper aims to contribute to this gap.
 
 We argue that the scarce attention that residential investment receives is not compatible with its macroeconomic relevance.
 Besides the recent interest in the macroeconomic consequences of residential investment to the business cycle and long-run economic growth \cite{fiebiger_trend_2017,fiebiger_semi-autonomous_2018,perez_Montiel_2021}, there is not a consensus about its determinants.
 
-Our main objective is to present and evaluate a parsimonious way of explaining the behavior residential investment growth rate, focusing on the US case (1992-2019).
-We will base this explanation on a single index that combines two relevant variables of the housing market: mortgages rate of interest and house price inflation.
-In Section \ref{sec:Stylized_Facts}, we discuss the macroeconomic relevance of residential investment regarding the US case.
-Next, in Section \ref{sec:empirical_review}, we review works that estimates the determinants of residential investment.

 In this appendix we report some hypothesis tests: unit root tests on our variables of interest, Structural break test, Johansen procedure and hypothesis tests on residuals.

 As shown in Table \ref{unitroot}, the null hypothesis of a unit root in the first differences of the series is overwhelmingly rejected.
 As mentioned, we found structural breaks related to institutional changes and our series are co-integrated (see Tables \ref{structbreak} and \ref{Johansen}).
 Our estimation order selection was based both on statistical and theoretical reasoning with homoscedasticity residuals (see Tables \ref{criterios} and \ref{testes_resduos}).
-All expected results are statistically significant and most of them are not restrict to model specification (see Table \ref{tab:robust}).
+All expected results are statistically significant and most of them are not restrict to model specification.
+Table \ref{tab:robust} provides a robustness check.
+In the last column of this tables we show which expected result listed in Table \ref{tab:resultados_esperados} holds for different time lags.
