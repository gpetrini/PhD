Non-residential investment is the most scrutinized variable in demand-led growth models so that others expenditures play a secondary role cite:brochier_macroeconomics_2017.
A decade after the Great Recession, this is still the case for residential investment which continues to receive sparse and unsystematic attention by the literature cites:caverzasi_stock-flow_2013,nikolaidi_minsky_2017.
Despite its absence in theoretical models, there is a growing empirical literature highlighting its macrodynamic relevance cites:leamer_housing_2007,jorda_great_2014,fiebiger_semi-autonomous_2018,fiebiger_trend_2017.
In this paper, we try to fill this gap in demand-led growth agenda.


Sraffian supermultiplier growth model (SSM) establishes an important role to non-capacity creating (NCC) autonomous expenditures.
textcite:serrano_long_1995 --- and also more recent papers cite:freitas_growth_2015 --- presents the SSM model in a rather parsimonious way as an alternative closure within demand-led growth model agenda cite:serrano_sraffian_2017.
More recently, SSM has been introduced to a broader Post-Keynesian audience by textcites:allain_tackling_2015,lavoie_post-keynesian_2015,lavoie_convergence_2016.
In summary,  SSM describes a demand-led growth pattern led by NCC autonomous expenditures such as residential investment.

Different NCC autonomous expenditures have been included in this framework. 
For instance, some scholars have investigated the macroeconomic implications of both debt-financed cites:pariboni_autonomous_2015,fagundes_role_2017,mandarino-2020-worker-debt and financial wealth-financed consumption cite:brochier_supermultiplier_2018.
The same applies to government expenditures cites:allain_tackling_2015,bougrine_autonomous_2020 and exports cite:nah_long-run_2017.
Nevertheless, residential investment --- another NCC autonomous expenditure --- has been systematically neglected. 
One way to include residential investment with the SSM model is through houses' own interest rate proposed by textcite:teixeira_crescimento_2015.
This particular real interest rate is the relevant one for house investors (households) and allow us to include asset bubble in a SSM-friendly framework.

In this paper, we include residential investment into the Sraffian supermultiplier model within a Stock-Flow Consistent framework. 
In Section ref:sec:empirical we introduce the so-called houses own interest rate and some residential investment related stylized facts.
Section ref:sec:Review reviews heterodox growth models with NCC autonomous expenditures and highlights the lack of residential investment as an autonomous expenditure.
In Section ref:sec:Model we present our SSM-SFC model  with two real assets: firms' capital and household' real estate. 
Section ref:sec:runs evaluates both short-run and fully-adjusted position equilibria in order to access the consequences of residential investment inclusion on stock-flow consistent ratios.
Next, in Section ref:sec:Experiments, we evaluate both traverse and steady-state dynamics through numerical simulations.
The experiments are: decrease in wage-share (Section ref:sec:Exp1); increase in real estate inflation (Section ref:sec:Exp2); and an increase in interest rate ref:sec:Exp3).
In this same Section, we also plug houses own interest rate observed data for the U.S. (from 1992 to 2019) in order to compare our simulations' results  with recent housing bubble episode.
Section ref:sec:Conclusion offers some concluding remarks while Appendix ref:append:Solution provides the analytical solution in order to assess stability condition and Appendix ref:append:Data presents simulation's parameters and baseline values.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
The analytical solution is presented in Section ref:sec:Solution in order to assess stability condition since residential investment growth rate is now described by houses' own interest rate.
