Long-run effective demand and residential investment: a Sraffian
supermultiplier based analysis
Gabriel Petrini, Lucas Teixeira
December 17, 2020

Abstract
In this paper, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier stock-flow consistent model (SSM-SFC) with two non-capacity creating autonomous expenditure: residential
investment and debt-financed consumption. Our model represents a closed and without government economy with workers and capitalist households and only the latter are not credit
constrained. The introduction of residential investment implies that our SSM-SFC model has
two real assets: firms’ productive capital and households’ real estate. In our model, residential
investment growth rate responds to changes of house price inflation. The numerical simulation experiments shows that our model keeps the main standard Sraffian supermultiplier growth
models results. As a particular result, an increase of residential investment growth rate increase
implies a decrease of real estate share in total real assets. Inspired by the recent U.S. bubble
episode, we plug house price inflation data (1992-2019). Although simple, our numerical simulations are capable to reproduce some stylized facts such as residential investment leading the
business cycle and capital accumulation and a clockwise pattern between non-capacity creating
autonomous expenditures and capacity utilization rate.

Introduction

Non-residential investment is the most scrutinized variable in demand-led growth models so that
others expenditures are given a secondary role (brochier; macedo e silva, 2017). More than
a decade after the Great Recession (2008-9), this is still the case for residential investment which
continues to receive sparse and unsystematic attention by the literature (caverzasi; godin, 2014;
nikolaidi; stockhammer, 2017). Despite its absence in theoretical models, there is a growing
empirical literature highlighting its macrodynamic relevance (leamer, 2007; jordà et al., 2016;
fiebiger, 2018; fiebiger; lavoie, 2018).
Sraffian supermultiplier growth model (SSM) establishes an important role to non-capacity creating (NCC) autonomous expenditures such as residential investment. Serrano (1995) and Serrano
and Freitas (2017) present a simple version of the SSM model to highlight it as an alternative closure
for heterodox growth theory. More recently, Allain (2015) and Lavoie (2014, 2016) have introduced
SSM to a broader Post-Keynesian audience.
Different NCC autonomous expenditures have been included in this framework. For instance,
some scholars have investigated the macroeconomic implications of both debt-financed (pariboni,
2015; fagundes; freitas, 2018; mandarino et al., 2020) and financial wealth-financed consumption (brochier; macedo e silva, 2019). The same applies to government expenditures (allain,
2015; dutt, 2020) and exports (nah; lavoie, 2017).

Even though these works emphasize the relevance of some NCC autonomous expenditures, residential investment has received little attention. Zezza (2008) and Nikolaidi (2015) include residential
investment in a SFC model with others objectives than its implications to economic growth and
business cycles. In a recent contribution, Dejuán and McCombie (2018) present an SSM model with
residential investment. They build a model in order to analyze the destabilizing effects of household
over-indebtedness without exploring the determinants of residential investment.
This paper is a first step in building the connection between house price inflation and residential
investment whitin a demand-led growth model. In order to do so, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier stock-flow consistent model (SSM-SFC) with residential investment.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discuss some residential investment
related stylized facts for the US economy related to house bubble, residential investment and its
macroeconomic implications. Section 3 presents a SSM-SFC model with asset bubbles and two
real assets: firms’ capital and household’ real estate. Section 4 evaluates short- and long-run
equilibria as well as traverse in order to assess the consequences of the inclusion of residential
investment to the output level, growth rate and to stock-flow ratios. Next, Section 5 evaluates this
relations through numerical simulations. Inspired by the U.S. 2000s housing bubble episode, the
experiments are: decrease in wage-share (Section 5.1); increase in real estate inflation (Section 5.2);
and an increase in interest rate (Section 5.3). In this same Section, we also plug houses own rate of
interest observed data for the U.S. (from 1992 to 2019) in order to compare simulations’ results with
the stylized facts presented previously. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks while Appendix
A provides simulation’s parameters and baseline values and Appendix B presents a preliminary
sensibility analysis.

Empirical Motivation

A growing body of empirical demand-led literature has evaluated the role of NCC autonomous
expenditures. Freitas and Dweck (2013) present a growth accounting decomposition for Brazil
from 1970 to 2005 and report the relevance of those expenditures in describing Brazilian GDP
growth rate. Braga (2020) shows evidence that economic growth and non-residential investment
are explained by NCC autonomous expenditures in the Brazilian economy from 1962 to 2015. For
the U.S., Girardi and Pariboni (2016) show that NCC autonomous expenditures have permanent
effects on growth rate. Haluska et al. (2020) employ Granger-causality tests to assess the stability
of the SSM for the US (1987-2017) and report a causality from NCC autonomous expenditures to
the marginal propensity to invest, as expected. Finally, Girardi and Pariboni (2020) bring evidence
that those expenditures determine investment share on GDP for twenty OECD countries.
However, there still is a lack of studies on the role of residential investment specifically. It is
worth mentioning that the discussion about this NCC autonomous expenditure is largely based on
Green (1997) pioneer work. Based on Granger Causality and cointegration tests for the US from
1959-1992, this is one of the first papers to indicates that residential investment leads the business
cycle. Subsequently, Leamer (2007) concludes that this pattern occurs at least since the post-war
period. More precisely, Leamer (2007, p. 8) describes US business cycles as follows: “[f]irst homes,
then cars, and last business equipment”. Recently, Fiebiger (2018) and Fiebiger and Lavoie (2018)
also report residential investment as an important determinant of business cycles for the US based
on causal narratives. Alternatively, Huang et al. (2020) estimate a Structural Vector Autoregressive
(SVEC) model in a time-scale framework for the OECD countries to assess both prediction and
causality relations stated by Leamer (2007). They report that residential investment predicts the
US macroeconomic fluctuation and housing related variables (house prices, real mortgage rate —

2

deflated by a consumer price index — and credit spread) lead the business cycle in all G7 countries.
After the Great Recession (2008-2009), there has been growing macroeconometric studies on
housing. However, most of them have emphasized house prices and not its volume (residential
investment). Goodhart and Hofmann (2008) for instance, estimate a time-series fixed effects panel
data for 17 industrialized countries from 1970 to 2006. They report a multidirectional relation
between money, credit, house prices and GDP growth and have found stronger effects during housing booms1 . Wood and Stockhammer (2020) report that house prices are relevant for describing
household indebtedness from 1980 to 2017 in 18 advance economies. However, both studies do not
include residential investment. Arestis and González-Martínez (2014), on the other side, include
residential investment. Using a ARDL model for 17 OECD countries from 1970 to 2013, the authors
report that banking credit and real house prices are the most statistically significant variables for
real residential investment in the US. Although those approaches are interesting, they fails to take
into account the connection between asset bubbles and aggregate demand.
From this review of recent empirical literature, it is noticeable that few macroeconometric studies have investigated residential investment in any systematic way. In this paper, we argue that
besides this growing body of literature that recognizes the macroeconomic importance of residential
investment, little progress has been made in connecting house bubbles with its macroeconomics
consequences. On the following subsection, we present some residential investment-related stylized
facts in order to highlight its relevance for the US business cycle which will be compared to the
theoretical model in Section 5.4. Next, we analyze the connection between residential investment,
real estate inflation and mortgage interest rate during the U.S. housing bubble episode.

2.1

Residential investment stylized facts

As discussed before, both Green (1997) and Leamer (2007) made it clear how important this particular expenditure is to USA business cycle. In this subsection, we show some residential investment
stylized facts for the US in more detail.
Figure 1 shows how residential investment movements help to predict recessions. Recessions
are anticipated by a reduction of residential investment share on GDP, while the expansion of
those expenditures precedes economic recovery. The fall of residential investment in 1966-67 are an
exception because the increase of military expenditures because of Vietnam War offset an eventual
economic downturn (leamer, 2007, p. 20). Another exception is the dot-com bubble 2000 crisis
that was not caused by residential investment.
In order to depict the relation between residential investment and business cycle, we present
Figure 2 in which each cycle is represented in a different panel2 . Residential investment-GDP ratio
and rate of capacity utilization — as a proxy for business cycle — are presented on vertical and
horizontal axis respectively. Economic recovery is generally characterized by residential investment
growing faster than GDP. Both residential investment share on GDP and capacity utilization increase as a consequence of higher residential investment growth rate. Accordingly to the Sraffian
Supermultiplier model, we can interpret subsequent non-residential investment increase as a result
of capital stock adjustment principle. This increase implies GDP to grow faster than residential
investment, therefore reducing both its share on GDP and rate of capacity utilization. As a result
of economic burst, rate of capacity utilization falls and the cycle ends. This pattern is more evident
in the 1970-75, 1982-91 and in the Great Recession.
1

Arestis and González (2014) also found a direct relationship between house prices and credit volume based on
cointegration and error correction techniques for 9 OECD countries from 1970 to 2011.
2
Similar reasoning can be found in Fiebiger and Lavoie (2018). Unlike them, we plot only residential investment
without including other households expenses financed by credit.

2.2

Housing bubble and residential investment

Once residential investment is relevant to describe the U.S. business cycle, it is important to understand its determinants. There are at some key variables to assess the residential investment
behavior. The first one is the mortgage interest rate, which determines the financial cost of buying
houses and the weight of debt-service on house investors’ income. The other is the rate of change
of house prices. The one who owns a house — or intend to buy one — takes its price variation in
consideration for speculative reasons or just to prevent capital loss and reductions of net worth.
Based on sraffa’s (1932) commodity rate of interest, Teixeira (2015) proposes the so-called
houses own rate of interest. Estimated by deflating mortgages interest by houses price inflation,
this particular real interest rate is the most relevant for house buyers since it is the real cost in
real estate from buying houses (teixeira, 2015, p. 53). This particular interest rate is shown in
Equation 1 in which own stands for houses own rate of interst, rmo for mortgage interest rate and
π for house price inflation.
1 + rmo

(1)
1+π
During a housing bubble period, it is real estate inflation that governs own’s interest rate
movements. Therefore, the lower this rate is, the greater the capital gains (in real estate) for
speculating with real estate will be. This negative relation between houses own interest rate and
residential investment is shown in Figure 3 in which this particular real interest rate has been
gradually decreased over the real estate boom (2002-5). Additionally, Figure 3 illustrates how this
procedure is more adequate than a consumer price index deflation — as Fair (2013, p. 143–6) does
— to describe residential investment growth rate3 .
In summary, we presented some stylized facts that highlights the relevance of residential investment for the U.S. business cycle and the relevance of house bubbles to the residential investment.

Based on this concept, Petrini (2020) estimated time series econometric model for the U.S. (1992 to 2019) and
presents empirical evidence that residential investment growth rate and houses own rate of interest have a common
negative long-run trend. Furthermore, Petrini (2020) also reports a unidirectional long-run causality from houses own
rate of interest to residential investment growth rate.

In the next section, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier stock-flow consistent model (SSM-SFC) to deal with these stylized facts.

3.1

A Sraffian supermultiplier SFC model with residential investment
General equations

Our model is the most parsimonious as possible: a closed capitalist economy without government
sector. Output (Y ) is determined by a fixed combination of a homogeneous labor (L) input with
homogeneous fixed business capital (Kf ). For simplicity, we put technological progress, depreciation
and goods inflation aside so investment is presented in net terms and all variables — except for
houses — are measured in real terms. Assuming a Leontief production function (Equation 2) and
that growth is not constrained by labor scarcity, full capacity output (YF C ) is determined by firms’
capital stock (Equation 3):
YF C = min(YL , YK )
(2)
YF C =
u=

Kf−1
v

Y
YF C

(3)
(4)

where YL and YK stands for full employment and full capacity output respectively, v is exogenous
capital-output ratio and u is rate of capacity utilization.

We further assume an economic structure composed by both workers (denoted by subscript w)
and capitalists (denoted by subscript k) households. Thus, demand-determined output level (Y ,
Equation 7) is the sum of workers and capitalists consumption (Cw and Ck respectively) and both
households and firms investment (Ih and If respectively) and only the latter creates capacity to the
business sector of the economy:
C = Cw + Ck

It = If + Ih

Capitalists

In other words, from institutional sectors perspective, household expenditures have two components (consumption and residential investment) and firms just one (non-residential investment). So,
the novelty of this model is the inclusion of a second investment component all made by household
sector and held by capitalists households for simplicity. Therefore, this economy produces two types
of real assets: firms productive capital (Kf ) and households houses (Kh ):
K = Kf + Kh

(8)

Denoting the houses share in total real assets as k (Equation 9), we can rewrite equation 8 as:
k=

Kh
K

K = (1 − k) · K + k · K

6

(9)

Following Sraffian literature, functional income distribution is determined both by historicalinstitutional factors and class struggle. As consequence, wage-share (ω) is considered exogenous to
our model and define total wages as (W , Eq. 10):
W =ω·Y

(10)

Table 1 presents the balance sheet matrix for all institutional sectors. Capitalists households
hold financial wealth as bank deposits (M ) and residential investment is financed by mortgages
(M O). Capitalists’ total net wealth (N Wk ) is the sum of their net financial wealth (Vk ) and real
assets (i.e. houses, Kh ). Table 2 presents both transactions flows and the flow of funds matrix.
This table shows all economic relations between institutional sectors ensuring that there is no “black
holes” so all financial and real transaction are explicitly defined (godley; lavoie, 2007; macedo
e silva; dos santos, 2011).
In this model, capitalist consumption (Ck ) is fully autonomous and financed by loans (Lk ) while
workers consumption (Cw ) is fully induced by their wages. We assume that workers expend what
they earn while capitalists earn what they expend, so workers financial and real wealth are both
null. Firms finance their investment primarily by undistributed profits (F U ) and the residual by
bank loans (Lf ) — thus they do not hold deposits. Banks create credit ex nihilo and then collect
the deposits, paying the same interest rate that they charge. On the following subsections, we will
present the equations of each of these institutional sectors.

3.2

Firms

In order to produce, firms purchase capital goods (−If in capital account) and hire workers, whom
total remuneration is the economy wage bill. Firms total profits (F T , Equation 11) are a residual
between sales (Y ) and total wages (W ). Firms retain part (γF ) of profits net of interest payments
(F U , Equation 12) — to reinvest — and distribute the remainder to capitalists (F D, Equation 13):
FT = Y − W = FD + FU

(11)

F U = γF · (F T − rl · Lf−1 )

(12)

F D = (1 − γF ) · (F T − rl · Lf−1 )

(13)

Firms (non-residential) investment is fully induced by the level of effective demand (Eq. 14), and
its growth rate changes accordingly to the capital stock adjustment principle (freitas; serrano,
2015). Equation 15 is a simple way to describe this mechanism. According to it, the marginal
propensity to invest (h) endogenously adjust to discrepancies between actual and normal utilization
rates (u and uN , respectively). For this mechanism to take place, the adjustment parameter (γu )
must be sufficiently small and non-negative4 . As a consequence, productive capacity gradually
adjusts to effective demand.
If = ht−1 · Y

(14)

∆h = ht−1 · γu · (u − uN )

(15)

∆Kf = If

(16)

4
The size of this parameter guards a fundamental relation to the stability of the model, as shown by Freitas and
Serrano (2015).

8

Firms finance investment that exceeds undistributed profits by bank loans, paying an interest
rate on it (rl ) charged by the banks. We assume an elastic supply of credit for investment. Moreover,
tables 1 and 2 show firms net wealth (N Wf ) and net financial balance (N F Wf ) explicitly:
∆Lf = If − F U

(17)

N F Wf = F U − If

where rg and rn denotes gross and net profit rate respectively.

3.3

Banks

As in most part of SFC literature, banks do not have an active role in this model. They create money
as credit is demanded and just after they collect deposits (le bourva, 1992). Firms finance part of
their investment with credit (Lf ) and capitalists households finance all their residential investment
by mortgages (M O) and consumption by loans (Lk ), as already mentioned. For simplicity, we
assume null bank spreads (σmo = σl = 0) so interest rate on mortgages (rmo ) and on loans (rl )
are the same as on deposits (rm ) which is exogenously determined by banks. Banks net balances
(N F Wb ) are defined by interests received net of interests payments. As those interests are the same,
banks net wealth is necessarily zero (see table 1) and deposits are residuum:
L = Lf + Lk

(22)

rl = (1 + σl ) · rm

(23)

rmo = (1 + σmo ) · rm

(24)

rm = rm

(25)

N F Wb = rmo · M O−1 + rl · L−1 − rm · M−1

(26)

N F Wb = ∆M O + ∆L − ∆M
N Wb = Vb ≡ 0

(27)

∆M = ∆L + ∆M O

(28)

3.4

Households

Workers
As mentioned before, we assume that workers expend (Cw ) what they earn (W ). For simplicity, we
consider that wages are the only source of workers’ disposable income (Y Dw ) and do not have access
to consumption loans, so worker’ saving (Shw ) are null. Therefore, accordingly to our hypothesis,
workers’ do not hold both net financial (N F Ww ) and total wealth (Vw ).
Cw = W

(29)

Y Dw = W

(30)

Sw = Y Dw − Cw

(31)

Sw = 0
N F Ww = Sw = 0

(32)

Vw = 0

(33)

Capitalists
This is the most complex institutional sector of our model. We assume consumption (Ck ) is fullyautonomous and financed by loans (Lk ). Disposable income (Y Dk ) is the sum of distributed profits
and received interests on deposits, net of interests payments on both mortgages and loans. Capitalists savings (Sk ) are disposable income net of consumption. At odds with SFC literature, savings
are not equal to net balance (N F Wk , Equation 37) since we have included residential investment.
∆Lk = Ck

(34)

Y Dk = F D + rm · M−1 − rmo · M O−1 − rl · Lk−1

(35)

S k = Y D k − Ck

(36)

N F Wk = Sk − Ih

(37)

As mentioned before, capitalist households are the only institutional sector investing in houses
which are financed by mortgages as in equation (38). Thus, capitalists’ total debt stock (D) is the
sum of mortgage and consumption loans (Equation 39)
∆M O = Ih

(38)

D = M O + Lk

(39)

10

Next, we present residential investment growth rate (gIh ) as determined by houses own rate of
interest (own, equation 1) as introduced by Teixeira (2015) and discussed in section 2.
Ih = (1 + gIh ) · Ih−1

(40)

gIh = φ0 − φ1 · own

(41)

where φ0 represents long-term determinants of residential investment (e.g. demographic factors,
housing and credit policies, etc.)5 while φ1 captures houses own rate of interest as described in
Section 2.2.
Accordingly to our hypothesis, nominal (Vnk ) and real net wealth (Vk ) are distinguished only
by the inclusion of house price (ph ) and are defined as follows:
Vk = Khd + M − Lk − M O

(42)

Vnk = Khd · ph + M − Lk − M O

(43)

In order to fulfill our goals, we employ freitas; christianes’s (2020) procedure in which NCC
autonomous expenditure (Z) composition (R) remains unchanged. Thus, we can express capitalists
total consumption as follows:
Z = Ck + Ih

(44)

Ck
Ih
+
= R + (1 − R)
Z
Z
which allows us to rewrite both residential investment and capitalists consumption in terms of
residential investment (Eq. 46):
Ck = R · Z
(45)
Z=

Ih
(1 − R)

Ck = Ih ·

R
(1 − R)

(46)
(47)

Finally, we can describe NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate as follows:
g Ck = g Z = g Ih = φ0 − φ1 · own

(48)

In this section, we presented a fully-specified parsimonious model to connect house bubbles with
aggregate demand. In the next Section, we analyze the dynamics from short- to long-run equilibria.

Short and long-run equilibria
From short- to long-run equilibria

In this Section, we show the implications of residential investment inclusion into a SSM-SFC model.
First, we present the short-run dynamics and then move to the traverse and then to the long-run
equilibrium (denoted by ?).

For an early discussion about long-term determinants of residential investment see Grebler et al. (1956). For a
historical-institutional discussing of mortgage markets, see Green and Wachter (2005).

4.1.1

Short-run good market equilibrium

In this model, real output (equation 7) is the sum of household consumption (equation 5) and both
types of investment (equation 6). If we replace equations 10 and 14 into 7 and considering equation
44 we get the short-run GDP level which is determined both by NCC expenditures (Zt ) and the
supermultiplier (inverse of Equation 49 denominator)
Zt
1 − ht − ω

(49)

Ih
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω)

(50)

Yt =
and replacing Equation 46 in the previous one
Yt =

since R is non-negative and lower than one, the Keynesian stability condition is ht + ω < 1.
Next, dividing equation 50 by 3, replacing residential investment growth rate by Equation 41
and rearranging, we get the short-run equilibrium utilization rate (Equation 51). In this model,
residential investment growth rate determines GDP growth rate. When the latter accelerates, rate
of capacity utilization increases as shown by Equation 51:
ut =

Iht−1 (1 + gIh )
v
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω) Kft−2 (1 + gKt−1 )

(51)

Replacing equation 41 in Equation 51 we make explicit the functional form of residential investment
growth rate as one of the determinants of rate of capacity utilization as shown in Equation 52:
ut =

Iht−1 (1 + φ0 − φ1 · ownt )
v
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω) Kft−2
(1 + gKt−1 )

(52)

Next, we revisit Equation 51 in order to present houses share on total capital stock (k). To do
so, we express firms’ capital in terms of houses. Then, dividing both sides of equation 51 by houses
and after some algebraic manipulations, we get houses-to-capital ratio (Equation 53)
k=
4.1.2

(1 − R) · (1 − ht − ω)
ht + (1 − R) · (1 − ht − ω)

(53)

Traverse and long-run equilibrium

In this subsection, we present traverse and long-run equilibrium equations. According to equation
51, when aggregate demand and capacity output grow at different rates, capacity utilization will
change. This discrepancy triggers marginal propensity to invest adjustment mechanism (see Equation 15). During the adjustment process, both supermultiplier and NCC autonomous expenditure
share on GDP changes. Equation 54 presents aggregate demand during the traverse:
∆h
(54)
1 − ω − ht
This process continues as long as GDP growth rate moves towards NCC autonomous expenditure
growth rate (in this case, residential investment and capitalist consumption). Next, we analyze the
long-run equilibrium values and steady growth stock ratios.
As mentioned before, firms’ marginal propensity to invest reacts to discrepancies between the
rate of capacity utilization and the normal one. This adjustment process continues until actual and
normal rate of capacity utilization are equal:
gt = gZ +

12

u → u? = uN ⇔ g → g ? = gZ = gIh
and long-run marginal propensity to invest will be:
v
(55)
u?
Finally, replacing Equation 55 into Equation 49 we obtain long-run GDP level as shown in Equation
h? = g ? ·

Once again, we can show the long-run position making the residential investment growth rate
explicit as in Equation 57

Y? =

Next, we move towards the analysis of the particularities of our model. To do so, we replace
Equation 55 in 53, we obtain long-run ratio between houses and total capital stock (denoted by k ? ):
h?
h? + (1 − R)(1 − h? − ω)

k? = 1 −

(58)

Before moving to the numerical simulations, we present some steady growth stock ratios in
order to shed some lights in the dynamic process of the model. At odds with literature, we do
not normalize the stocks by the total capital stock, but by the economically relevant capital (firms’
capital stock or houses) type. Thus, dividing Equation 17 by firms’ capital stock and making some
algebraic manipulation, we obtain steady growth loans’ ratio to firms’ capital stock (`? , Equation

Numerical Simulations

In this Section, we present the results of the following experiments: (i) wage-share decrease; (ii)
house price inflation; (iii) deposits interest rate increase. In order to evaluate if our model is able
to reproduce some stylized facts, we introduce U.S. houses own rate of interest observed data (from
1992 to 2019) into our numerical simulation. Before we move foward, it is worth mentioning that we
use fazzari et al.’s (2020) parameter values calibrated for the U.S. economy for a similar time range
(from 1980 to 2016). Our first experiment assess if income distribution has a level effect on output
— as in (mandarino et al., 2020) — or growth rate effect — as in (brochier; macedo e silva,
2019). Real estate inflation increase experiment is motivated by recent US experience (from 1992
to 2019) as discussed in Section 2 while the last simulation aims to evaluate indebtedness stability.
Table 4 in Appendix A presents the parameters of simulation and Table 3 compare each result to
baseline.

5.1

Wage-share decrease

A wage-share decrease has permanent negative impact on output level — due to changes in the
supermultiplier — and temporary negative effects on degree of capacity utilization (see Figure 4
A). So, aggregate demand growth level is temporarily smaller than baseline as a result of the lower
supermultiplier. As a consequence of this negative level effect, both accumulation growth rate and
marginal propensity to invest temporaly decline while NCC autonomous expenditures share on
GDP increases. Since NCC autonomous expenditures growth rate remains unchanged and its share
on GDP increases, aggregate demand grows faster than accumulation rate. As a result, degree of
capacity utilization is higher than the normal one. During the traverse, marginal propensity to
invest endogenously adjust to discrepancies between actual and normal capacity utilization rates.
Consequently, non-residential investment growth rate increases faster than aggregate demand. This
endogenous adjustment process continues as long as actual rate of capacity utilization is different

14

from the normal one. In summary, we report standards SSM model results: (i) marginal propensity to invest decrease is temporally and returns to baseline level; (ii) rate of capacity utilization
moves towards normal one; (iii) supermultiplier decreases and autonomous expenditures share increases due to GDP decline and; (iv) since autonomous expenditures growth rate does not change,
distribution effects on growth rates are temporary.
Despite temporary growth rate effects, wage-share decrease has a permanent effect in house
share on total capital stock (see Equation 58 and Figure 5 B). As a consequence of the initially
lower accumulation rate, total capital stock also grows at a temporarily lower rate. However, since
residencial investment growth rate remains unchanged, its share on total capital stock increases.
Finally, we also report a persistent effect on firms’ balance sheet due to wage-share decrease.
The negative level effect on GDP implies an already mentioned temporally decrease in marginal
propensity to invest. As a consequence of the initially lower accumulation rate and higher profit
share, firms’ loan-to-capital ratio decrease. Thus, according to Equation 60, gross and net profit
rate remain persistently close to each other (see Figure 5 D). Therefore, as profits distribution policy
remains the same, firms require less external funding so its indebtedness decreases.

5.2

Real estate inflation increase

An increase of real estate inflation implies a higher residential investment growth due to houses
own rate of interest decrease. As a result, both GDP growth rate and degree of capacity utilization
increase as well. Since firms react to discrepancies between actual and normal degree of capacity
utilization rate, non-residential investment growth rate is temporally higher than GDP growth rate
due to marginal propensity to invest adjustment. Furthermore, capitalists’ disposable income also
increases as a result of the already mentioned higher GDP growth rate. Since loans interest remains
unchanged, capitalists’ indebtedness ratio decreases. During the traverse, gross and net profit rate
are temporally close to each other as a result of profits level increase, so firms’ indebtedness decreases
as well. Therefore, similar to Mandarino et al. (2020), we also report paradox of debt.
In summary, we report SSM standard long-run results: (i) GDP growth rate converges to NCC
autonomous expenditure growth rate; (ii) marginal propensity to invest remains persistently higher
compared to baseline and; (iii) utilization rate moves gradually towards the normal one. As mentioned before, our model distinctiveness is the existence of two types of capital stocks since households invest as well.
The most distinct result is real houses share decreases on total capital stock as a result of
residential investment growth rate increase. Although counterintuitive, this result is similar to the
conventional paradox of debt. This is the case since houses are always equivalent to mortgage
debt. Additionally, this result is in line with SSM literature. Firms investment follows capital stock
adjustment principle, so a higher firms investment growth rate implies that GDP grows faster than
residential investment. Thus, both residential investment share on GDP and degree of capacity
utilization decrease. In other words, both autonomous expenditures share on GDP and houses
share on real assets decline as a result of the already described non-residential investment positive
reaction.

5.3

Interest rate increase

A increase in benchmark interest rate has a persistent effect on long-run growth rate since houses
own interest rate increases as well6 . Non-residential investment growth rate decreases as a result
6
Since we assume null spread on both mortgage and loans interest rate, an increase on deposits interest rate also
increases the other ones. As a consequence, banks’ net financial wealth remains unchanged.

15

of residential investment growth rate permanent decline, so houses share on real assets increases.
Compared to the previous experiments, this shock has opposite effects on long-run growth rates,
NCC autonomous expenditure share on GDP, utilization rate and marginal propensity to invest
than the previous one (see Figure 4).
In particular, we report a stronger negative effect over both capitalists’ and firms’ balance
sheet than wage-share decrease (see figures 4 and 5). This effect is a result of the temporarily
stronger decline of GDP growth rate compared to NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate. As
a consequence of lower GDP growth rate, total profits also decreases. Thus, capitalists’ disposable
income decreases more than debt-financed consumption growth rate. Interest rate increase alone
is enough to capitalists’ indebtedness level to increase, however it is followed by GDP growth
rate decrease, so the overall effect is stronger than wage-share decrease experiment (Section 5.1).
Regarding firms’ balance sheet, we report a temporarily negative level effect on gross profit rate
and a permanent one on net profit rate. So, there is a permanent increase in the gap between them
due to increase in external funding and to the negative level effect on profits. Therefore, we find a
stable debt dynamics for both capitalists and firms (other parameters remaining unchanged).

Plugging real data

Finally, we include houses own rate of interest data discussed in section 2 (see Figure 3) into
our model. In order to do so, each year corresponds to ten simulated periods for visualization
reasons. Additionally, we have abandoned the assumption of a fixed share (R) between residential
investment and capitalist consumption. In order to include capitalists consumption without running
into asymptotic paths, we defined its growth rate as the geometric average of residential investment
growth rate from 1992 to 2019.
Although rudimentary, this procedure allows us to replicate some stylized facts presented in section 2 and in the literature (see Figure 6). Similarly to Figure 2, we report a clockwise relationship
between autonomous expenditure share on GDP and rate of capacity utilization. With due mediation, we also report a smooth gravitation of capacity utilization ratio towards the normal one. As
expected, NCC autonomous expenditures (notably residential investment) describes accumulation
and GDP growth rate. Together these results provide a first step towards the connection between
house bubbles and aggregate demand within the Sraffian Supermultiplier framework.

Concluding Remarks

This paper contributes to demand-led growth agenda, taking in consideration recent efforts of embedding it in a SFC framework. Our novelty is the introduction of residential investment determined
by houses own rate of interest in a SSM-SFC model. Residential investment has beeen included due
to recent empirical works showing its relevance for macroeconomic dynamics. Houses’ own rate of
interest allowed us to connect house bubbles with aggregate demand in a rather parsimonious way.
Our model reports standard results of Sraffian Supermultiplier: (i) utilization rate converges
to the normal one through changes on firms’ marginal propensity to invest; (ii) GDP growth rate
converges to NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate and; (iii) income distribution affects growth
rate only during the traverse. A particular feature of our model is the dual composition of capital
stock: firms’ capacity creating and real estate. The most distinct result is the decrease of houses
share on capital stock due to the increase of residential investment growth rate. Although counterintuitive, this occurs because firms react to the discrepancies between actual and desired utilization
rates. In other words, for capacity utilization converges to the normal one, firms’ investment needs
to grow temporarily faster than residential investment, changing the ratio between houses and total
capital stock in the long-run.
Future research should increase the complexity of this model in order to understand other consequences of residential investment. Some extensions could be exploring other determinants of its
growth rate and its effects on banks’ net financial wealth. This emerging “housing agenda” should
also moves towards institutional grounds. For example, future research could assess which institutional arrangements allow/inhibit the connection between house bubble, credit granting/rationing
and financial instability. Nevertheless, this is a first step in a wider research agenda on the role of
residential investment for economic growth and business cycles.
