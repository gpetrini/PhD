Long-run effective demand and residential
investment: a Sraffian supermultiplier based analysis
""
January 19, 2021
Abstract
In this paper, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier
stock-flow consistent model (SSM-SFC) with two non-capacity creating autonomous
expenditures: residential investment and debt-financed consumption. Our model
represents a closed and without government economy with workers and capitalists
households and only the latter are not credit constrained. The introduction of
residential investment implies that our SSM-SFC model has two real assets:
firms’ productive capital and households’ real estate. In our model, residential
investment growth rate responds to changes of house price inflation. The numerical
simulation experiments shows that our model keeps the main standard Sraffian
supermultiplier growth models results. As a particular result, an increase of
residential investment growth rate implies a decrease of real estate share in
total real assets. Inspired by the recent U.S. bubble episode, we plug house
price inflation data (1992-2019). Although simple, our numerical simulations are
capable to reproduce some stylized facts such as residential investment leading
the business cycle and capital accumulation and a clockwise pattern between
non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures and capacity utilization rate.
Keywords: Residential Investment; Sraffian supermultiplier; Asset bubble;

Introduction
Introduction

ignore

Non-residential investment is the most scrutinized variable in demand-led
growth models so that others expenditures are given a secondary role cite:brochiermacroeconomics2017 .
More than a decade after the Great Recession (2008-9), this is still the case for residential
investment which continues to receive sparse and unsystematic attention by the literature
cites:caverzasistock -flow2013,nikolaidiminsky2017 . Despite its absence in theoretical models,

there is a growing empirical literature highlighting its macrodynamic relevance cites:leamerhousing2007,jord
Sraffian supermultiplier growth model (SSM) establishes an important role
to non-capacity creating (NCC) autonomous expenditures such as residential investment.
textcite:serranolong1995,serranosraffian2017 present a simple version of the SSM model to
highlight it as an alternative closure for heterodox growth theory. More recently,
textcites:allaintackling2015,lavoiepost -keynesian2015,lavoieconvergence2016 have introduced SSM
to a broader Post-Keynesian audience.
Different NCC autonomous expenditures have been included in this framework.
For instance, some scholars have investigated the macroeconomic implications of both
debt-financed cites:pariboniautonomous2015,fagundesrole2017,mandarino -2020-worker-debt and
financial wealth-financed consumption cite:brochiersupermultiplier2018 . The same applies
to government expenditures cites:allaintackling2015,bougrineautonomous2020 and exports cite:nahlong -run2017 .
Even though these works emphasize the relevance of some NCC autonomous
3

expenditures, residential investment has received little attention. textcites:zezzau.s .2008,nikolaidisecuritisation2
include residential investment in a SFC model with others objectives than its implications

to economic growth and business cycles. In a recent contribution, textcite:dejuansupermultiplier -cum-finan
present an SSM model with residential investment. They build a model in order to
analyze the destabilizing effects of household over-indebtedness without exploring the
determinants of residential investment.
This paper is a first step in building the connection between house price
inflation and residential investment whitin a demand-led growth model. In order
to do so, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier stock-flow
consistent model (SSM-SFC) with residential investment.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section ref:sec:empirical
discuss some residential investment related stylized facts for the US economy and its
macroeconomic implications. Section ref:sec:Model presents a SSM-SFC model with
asset bubbles and two real assets: firms’ capital and household’ real estate. Section
ref:sec:runs evaluates short- and long-run equilibria as well as traverse in order to
assess the consequences of the inclusion of residential investment to the output level,
growth rate and to stock-flow ratios. Next, Section ref:sec:Experiments evaluates this
relations through numerical simulations. Inspired by the U.S. 2000s housing bubble
episode, the experiments are: decrease in wage-share (Section ref:sec:Exp1); increase
in real estate inflation (Section ref:sec:Exp2); and an increase in interest rate (Section
ref:sec:Exp3). In this same Section, we also plug houses own rate of interest observed
data for the U.S. (from 1992 to 2019) in order to compare simulations’ results with
4

the stylized facts presented previously. Section ref:sec:Conclusion offers some concluding
remarks while Appendix ref:append:Data provides simulation’s parameters and baseline
values and Appendix ref:append:Sensib presents a preliminary sensibility analysis.

Introduction

1. Literature state-of-art

ignore A growing body of empirical

demand-led literature has evaluated the role of NCC autonomous expenditures.
textcite:freitaspattern2013 present a growth accounting decomposition for Brazil
from 1970 to 2005 and report the relevance of those expenditures in describing
Brazilian GDP growth rate. textcite:bragainvestment2020 shows evidence that economic
growth and non-residential investment are explained by NCC autonomous expenditures
in the Brazilian economy from 1962 to 2015. For the U.S., textcite:girardilong -run2016
show that NCC autonomous expenditures have permanent effects on growth
rate. textcite:haluskagrowth2020 employ Granger-causality tests to assess the stability
of the SSM for the US (1987-2017) and report a causality from NCC autonomous

expenditures to the marginal propensity to invest, as expected. Finally, textcite:girardiautonomous20
bring evidence that those expenditures determine investment share on GDP for
twenty OECD countries.

2. Leamer and Fiebiger related

ignore However, there still is a lack of

studies on the role of residential investment specifically. It is worth mentioning
that the discussion about this NCC autonomous expenditure is largely based on
textcite:greenfollow1997 pioneer work. Based on Granger Causality and cointegration
tests for the US from 1959-1992, this is one of the first papers to indicates that
residential investment leads the business cycle. Subsequently, textcite:leamerhousing2007
concludes that this pattern occurs at least since the post-war period. More

3. Lack of residential investment literature

ignore After

the Great Recession (2008-2009), there has been growing macroeconometric
studies on housing. However, most of them have emphasized house prices and
not its volume (residential investment). textcite:goodharthouse2008 for instance,
estimate a time-series fixed effects panel data for 17 industrialized countries
from 1970 to 2006. They report a multidirectional relation between money,
credit, house prices and GDP growth and have found stronger effects during
housing booms1 . textcite:woodhouse2020 report that house prices are relevant for

textcite:ArestisBank2014 also found a direct relationship between house prices and credit volume
based on cointegration and error correction techniques for 9 OECD countries from 1970 to 2011.

describing household indebtedness from 1980 to 2017 in 18 advance economies.
However, both studies do not include residential investment. textcite:ArestisResidential2014 ,
on the other side, include residential investment. Using a ARDL model for 17
OECD countries from 1970 to 2013, the authors report that banking credit
and real house prices are the most statistically significant variables for real
residential investment in the US. Although those approaches are interesting,
they fail to take into account the connection between asset bubbles and aggregate
demand.
4. Section structure

ignore

From this review of recent empirical literature, it is noticeable that few macroeconometric
studies have investigated residential investment in any systematic way. In this
paper, we argue that besides this growing body of literature that recognizes the
macroeconomic importance of residential investment, little progress has been
made in connecting house bubbles with its macroeconomics consequences. On
the following subsection, we present some residential investment-related stylized
facts in order to highlight its relevance for the US business cycle which will be
compared to the theoretical model in Section ref:realsim . Next, we analyze the
connection between residential investment, real estate inflation and mortgage
interest rate during the U.S. housing bubble episode.

Residential investment stylized facts

1. Investmento residencial e o ciclo econômico

ignore As discussed before,

both textcites:greenfollow1997,leamerhousing2007 made it clear how important this
particular expenditure is to USA business cycle. In this subsection, we show
some residential investment stylized facts for the US in more detail.
Figure ref:InvestoResidGDP shows how residential investment movements help
to predict recessions. Recessions are anticipated by a reduction of residential
investment share on GDP, while the expansion of those expenditures precedes
economic recovery. The fall of residential investment in 1966-67 are an exception
because the increase of military expenditures because of Vietnam War offset
an eventual economic downturn [?, p. 20]. Another exception is the dot-com
bubble 2000 crisis that was not caused by residential investment.

In order to depict the relation between residential investment and business cycle,
we present Figure ref:fig:cycles in which each cycle is represented in a different
panel2 . Residential investment-GDP ratio and rate of capacity utilization —
as a proxy for business cycle — are presented on vertical and horizontal axis
respectively. Economic recovery is generally characterized by residential investment
growing faster than GDP. Both residential investment share on GDP and capacity
utilization increase as a consequence of higher residential investment growth
rate. Accordingly to the Sraffian Supermultiplier model, we can interpret subsequent
non-residential investment increase as a result of capital stock adjustment principle.
This increase implies GDP to grow faster than residential investment, therefore
reducing both its share on GDP and rate of capacity utilization. As a result
of economic burst, rate of capacity utilization falls and the cycle ends. This
pattern is more evident in the 1970-75, 1982-91 and in the Great Recession.

Similar reasoning can be found in textcite:fiebigertrend2017 . Unlike them, we plot only
residential investment without including other households expenses financed by credit.

2.1.3

Housing bubble and residential investment

Once residential investment is relevant to describe the U.S. business cycle,
it is important to understand its determinants. There are at some key variables to
assess the residential investment behavior. The first one is the mortgage interest rate,
which determines the financial cost of buying houses and the weight of debt-service
on house investors’ income. The other is the rate of change of house prices. The one
who owns a house — or intend to buy one — takes its price variation in consideration
for speculative reasons or just to prevent capital loss and reductions of net worth.
Based on *SraffaO wn1 9320 sSraf f aO wn1 932commodityrateof interest, textcite :

During a housing bubble period, it is real estate inflation that governs own’s
interest rate movements. Therefore, the lower this rate is, the greater the capital
gains (in real estate) for speculating with real estate will be. This negative relation
between houses own interest rate and residential investment is shown in Figure 2
in which this particular real interest rate has been gradually decreased over the real
estate boom (2002-5). Additionally, Figure ref:propriainvesto illustrates how this procedure
10

is more adequate than a consumer price index deflation — as [p. 143–6]fairm acroeconometric2 013does−

In summary, we presented some stylized facts that highlights the relevance
of residential investment for the U.S. business cycle and the relevance of house bubbles
to the residential investment. In the next section, we build a fully specified parsimonious
Sraffian supermultiplier stock-flow consistent model (SSM-SFC) to deal with these
stylized facts.
3

Based on this concept, textcite:petrinidemanda2019 estimated time series econometric model
for the U.S. (1992 to 2019) and presents empirical evidence that residential investment growth
rate and houses own rate of interest have a common negative long-run trend. Furthermore,
textcite:petrinidemanda2019 also reports a unidirectional long-run causality from houses own rate of
interest to residential investment growth rate.

3.1.1

General equations

Our model is the most parsimonious as possible: a closed capitalist economy
without government sector. Output (Y ) is determined by a fixed combination of a
homogeneous labor (L) input with homogeneous fixed business capital (Kf ). For
simplicity, we put technological progress, depreciation and goods inflation aside so
investment is presented in net terms and all variables — except for houses — are
measured in real terms. Assuming a Leontief production function (Equation ref:Leontieff )
and that growth is not constrained by labor scarcity, full capacity output (YF C ) is
determined by firms’ capital stock (Equation ref:YFC ):

\begin{equation}
\label{_Leontieff}
Y_{FC} = \min (Y_L, Y_K)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_YFC}
12

Y_{FC} = \frac{K_{f_{-1}}}{v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_u}
u = \frac{Y}{Y_{FC}}
\end{equation}

where YL and YK stands for full employment and full capacity output respectively, v
is exogenous capital-output ratio and u is rate of capacity utilization.
We further assume an economic structure composed by both workers (denoted
by subscript w) and capitalists (denoted by subscript k) households. Thus, demand-determined
output level (Y , Equation ref:Y ) is the sum of workers and capitalists consumption
(Cw and Ck respectively) and both households and firms investment (Ih and If respectively)
and only the latter creates capacity to the business sector of the economy:

\begin{equation}
\label{_Ct}
C = C_w + C_k
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_It}
I_t = I_f + I_h
\end{equation}
13

\begin{equation}
\label{_Y}

Y = \overbrace{[C_w + \underbrace{C_k + I_h}_{\text{Capitalists}}]}^{\text{Househo
\end{equation}

In other words, from institutional sectors perspective, household expenditures
have two components (consumption and residential investment) and firms just one
(non-residential investment). So, the novelty of this model is the inclusion of a second
investment component all made by household sector and held by capitalists households
for simplicity. Therefore, this economy produces two types of real assets: firms productive
capital (Kf ) and households houses (Kh ):

\begin{equation}
\label{_K}
K = K_f + K_h
\end{equation}

Denoting the houses share in total real assets as k (Equation ref:k ), we can
rewrite equation ?? as:

\begin{equation}
\label{_k}
k = \frac{K_h}{K}
\end{equation}
14

$$
K = (1-k)\cdot K + k\cdot K
$$

Following Sraffian literature, functional income distribution is determined by
historical-institutional factors and class struggle. As consequence, wage-share (ω) is
considered exogenous to our model and define total wages as (W , Eq. ref:W ):

\begin{equation}
\label{_W}
W = \omega\cdot Y
\end{equation}

Table ?? presents the balance sheet matrix for all institutional sectors. Capitalists
households hold financial wealth as bank deposits (M ) and residential investment
is financed by mortgages (M O). Capitalists’ total net wealth (N Wk ) is the sum of
their net financial wealth (Vk ) and real assets (i.e. houses, Kh ). Table ?? presents
both transactions flows and the flow of funds matrix. This table shows all economic
relations between institutional sectors ensuring that there is no “black holes” so all
financial and real transaction are explicitly defined cite:godleymonetary2007,macedoesilvapeering2011 .
In this model, capitalist consumption (Ck ) is fully autonomous and financed
by loans (Lk ) while workers consumption (Cw ) is fully induced by their wages. We
assume that workers expend what they earn while capitalists earn what they expend,
15

so workers financial and real wealth are both null. Firms finance their investment
primarily by undistributed profits (F U ) and the residual by bank loans (Lf ) — thus
they do not hold deposits. Banks create credit ex nihilo and then collect the deposits,
paying the same interest rate that they charge. On the following subsections, we will
present the equations of each of these institutional sectors.

3.1.2

Firms

In order to produce, firms purchase capital goods (−If in capital account)
and hire workers, whom total remuneration is the economy wage bill. Firms total
profits (F T , Equation ref:FT ) are a residual between sales (Y ) and total wages (W ).
Firms retain part (γF ) of profits net of interest payments (F U , Equation ref:FU ) — to
reinvest — and distribute the remainder to capitalists (F D, Equation ref:FD ):

\begin{equation}
\label{_FT}
FT = Y - W = FD + FU
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_FU}
FU = \gamma_F\cdot (FT - r_l\cdot L_{f_{-1}})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_FD}
FD = (1-\gamma_F)\cdot (FT - r_l\cdot L_{f_{-1}})
\end{equation}

Firms (non-residential) investment is fully induced by the level of effective
demand (Eq. ref:If ), and its growth rate changes accordingly to the capital stock
adjustment principle cite:freitasgrowth2015 . Equation ref:h is a simple way to describe
19

this mechanism. According to it, the marginal propensity to invest (h) endogenously
adjust to discrepancies between actual and normal utilization rates (u and uN , respectively).
For this mechanism to take place, the adjustment parameter (γu ) must be sufficiently
small and non-negative4 . As a consequence, productive capacity gradually adjusts to
effective demand.

\begin{equation}
\label{_If}
I_f = h_{t-1}\cdot Y
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_h}
\Delta h = h_{t-1}\cdot \gamma_u\cdot (u - u_N)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Delta K_f = I_f
\end{equation}

Firms finance investment that exceeds undistributed profits by bank loans,
paying an interest rate on it (rl ) charged by the banks. We assume an elastic supply
of credit for investment. Moreover, tables ?? and ?? show firms net wealth (N Wf )
and net financial balance (N F Wf ) explicitly:
4

The size of this parameter guards a fundamental relation to the stability of the model, as shown
by textcite:freitasgrowth2015 .

20

\begin{equation}
\label{_Lf}
\Delta L_f = I_f - FU
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
NFW_f = FU - I_f
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
NW_f = K_f - L_f
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_rg}
r_g = \frac{(1-\omega)\cdot u}{v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_rn}
r_n = r_g - r_l\cdot\frac{L_{f_{-1}}}{K_f}
\end{equation}

where rg and rn denotes gross and net profit rate respectively.

21

3.1.3

Banks

As in most part of SFC literature, banks do not have an active role in this
model. They create money as credit is demanded and just after they collect deposits
cite:lebourvamoney1992 . Firms finance part of their investment with credit (Lf ) and capitalists
households finance all their residential investment by mortgages (M O) and consumption
by loans (Lk ), as already mentioned. For simplicity, we assume null bank spreads
(σmo = σl = 0) so interest rate on mortgages (rmo ) and on loans (rl ) are the same
as on deposits (rm ) which is exogenously determined by banks. Banks net balances
(N F Wb ) are defined by interests received net of interests payments. As those interests
are the same, banks net wealth is necessarily zero (see table ??) and deposits are
residuum:

\begin{equation}
L = L_f + L_{k}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_l = (1+\sigma_l)\cdot r_m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_{mo} = (1+\sigma_{mo})\cdot r_m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_m = \overline r_m
22

\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
NFW_b = r_{mo}\cdot MO_{-1} + r_l\cdot L_{-1} - r_m\cdot M_{-1}
\end{equation}
$$
NFW_b = \Delta MO + \Delta L - \Delta M
$$
\begin{equation}
NW_b = V_b \equiv 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{_M}
\Delta M = \Delta L + \Delta MO
\end{equation}

3.1.4

Households

1. Workers
As mentioned before, we assume that workers expend (Cw ) what they earn
(W ). For simplicity, we consider that wages are the only source of workers’
disposable income (Y Dw ) and do not have access to consumption loans, so
worker’ saving (Shw ) are null. Therefore, accordingly to our hypothesis, workers
do not hold both net financial (N F Ww ) nor total wealth (Vw ).
23

\begin{equation}
C_w = W
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
YD_w = W
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
S_{w} = YD_w - C_w
\end{equation}
$$
S_{w} = 0
$$
\begin{equation}
NFW_{w} = S_{w} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{w} = 0
\end{equation}
2. Capitalists
This is the most complex institutional sector of our model. We assume consumption
(Ck ) is fully-autonomous and financed by loans (Lk ). Disposable income (Y Dk )
is the sum of distributed profits and received interests on deposits, net of interests
payments on both mortgages and loans. Capitalists savings (Sk ) are disposable
24

income net of consumption. At odds with SFC literature, savings are not equal
to net balance (N F Wk , Equation ref:NFWh) since we have included residential
investment.

\begin{equation}
\Delta L_{k} = C_k
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{EqYD}

YD_k = FD + \overline r_m\cdot M_{-1} - r_{mo}\cdot MO_{-1} - r_{l}\cdot L_{k
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{EqSh}
S_{k} = YD_k - C_k
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{NFWh}
NFW_{k} = S_{k} - I_h
\end{equation}

As mentioned before, capitalist households are the only institutional sector
investing in houses which are financed by mortgages as in equation ref:EqMO.
Thus, capitalists’ total debt stock (D) is the sum of mortgage and consumption
loans (Equation ref:kD )
25

∆M O = Ih

(2)

D = M O + Lk

(3)

Next, we present residential investment growth rate (gIh ) as determined by
houses own rate of interest (own, equation 1) as introduced by textcite:teixeiracrescimento2015
and discussed in section ref:sec:empirical.

\begin{equation}
I_h = (1 + g_{I_h})\cdot I_{h_{-1}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{g_Z_own}
g_{I_h} = \phi_0 - \phi_1\cdot own
\end{equation}

where φ0 represents long-term determinants of residential investment (e.g. demographic
factors, housing and credit policies, etc.)5 while φ1 captures houses own rate of
interest as described in Section ref:secown .
5

For an early discussion about long-term determinants of residential investment see
textcite:greblercapital1956 . For a historical-institutional discussing of mortgage markets, see
textcite:greenamerican2005 .

26

Accordingly to our hypothesis, nominal (Vnk ) and real net wealth (Vk ) are distinguished
only by the inclusion of house price (ph ) and are defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
V_{k} = K_{hd} + M - L_{k} - MO
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{nk} = K_{hd}\cdot p_h + M - L_{k} - MO
\end{equation}

In order to fulfill our goals, we employ *freitasb aseline2 0200 sciteyear : f reitasbaseline2020 procedure
composition (R) remains unchanged. Thus, we can express capitalists total
consumption as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{_Z}
Z = C_k + I_h
\end{equation}
$$
\frac{C_k}{Z} + \frac{I_h}{Z} = R + (1-R)
$$
which allows us to rewrite both residential investment and capitalists consumption
in terms of residential investment (Eq. ref:ZIh ):

Finally, we can describe NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate as follows:

In this section, we presented a fully-specified parsimonious model to connect
house bubbles with aggregate demand. In the next Section, we analyze the
dynamics from short- to long-run equilibria.

In this Section, we show the implications of residential investment inclusion
into a SSM-SFC model. First, we present the short-run dynamics and then move to
the traverse and then to the long-run equilibrium (denoted by ?).

4.1.1

Short-run good market equilibrium

In this model, real output (equation ??) is the sum of household consumption
(equation ref:Ct ) and both types of investment (equation ref:It ). If we replace equations
ref:W and ref:If into ref:Y and considering equation ref:Z we get the short-run GDP
level which is determined both by NCC expenditures (Zt ) and the supermultiplier
(inverse of Equation ref:Ynivel denominator)

Yt =

Zt
1 − ht − ω

(8)

and replacing Equation ref:ZIh in the previous one

Yt =

Ih
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω)

(9)

since R is non-negative and lower than one, the Keynesian stability condition is ht +
ω < 1.
Next, dividing equation ref:YIh by ref:YFC , replacing residential investment
growth rate by Equation ref:gZown and rearranging, we get the short-run equilibrium
utilization rate (Equation ref:shortu ). In this model, residential investment growth
rate determines GDP growth rate. When the latter accelerates, rate of capacity utilization
increases as shown by Equation ref:shortu :

ut =

Iht−1 (1 + gIh )
v
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω) Kft−2 (1 + gKt−1 )
29

(10)

Replacing equation ref:gZown in Equation ref:shortu we make explicit the functional
form of residential investment growth rate as one of the determinants of rate of capacity
utilization as shown in Equation ref:shortuown :

ut =

Iht−1 (1 + φ0 − φ1 · ownt )
v
(1 − R)(1 − ht − ω) Kft−2
(1 + gKt−1 )

(11)

Next, we revisit Equation ref:shortu in order to present houses share on
total capital stock (k). To do so, we express firms’ capital in terms of houses. Then,
dividing both sides of equation ref:shortu by houses and after some algebraic manipulations,
we get houses-to-capital ratio (Equation ref:kshort )

k=

ht + (1 − R) · (1 − ht − ω)

(12)

Traverse and long-run equilibrium

In this subsection, we present traverse and long-run equilibrium equations.
According to equation ref:shortu , when aggregate demand and capacity output grow
at different rates, capacity utilization will change. This discrepancy triggers marginal
propensity to invest adjustment mechanism (see Equation ref:h ). During the adjustment
process, both supermultiplier and NCC autonomous expenditure share on GDP changes.
Equation ref:gmedium presents aggregate demand during the traverse:

30

gt = gZ +

∆h
1 − ω − ht

(13)

This process continues as long as GDP growth rate moves towards NCC autonomous
expenditure growth rate (in this case, residential investment and capitalist consumption).
Next, we analyze the long-run equilibrium values and steady growth stock ratios.
As mentioned before, firms’ marginal propensity to invest reacts to discrepancies
between the rate of capacity utilization and the normal one. This adjustment process
continues until actual and normal rate of capacity utilization are equal:

u → u? = uN ⇔ g → g ? = gZ = gIh
and long-run marginal propensity to invest will be:

h? = g ? ·

v
u?

(14)

Finally, replacing Equation ref:hlong into Equation ref:Ynivel we obtain long-run GDP
level as shown in Equation

Once again, we can show the long-run position making the residential investment

(16)

Next, we move towards the analysis of the particularities of our model. To
do so, we replace Equation ref:hlong in ref:kshort , we obtain long-run ratio between
houses and total capital stock (denoted by k ? ):

k? = 1 −

h?
h? + (1 − R)(1 − h? − ω)

(17)

Before moving to the numerical simulations, we present some steady growth
stock ratios in order to shed some lights in the dynamic process of the model. At
odds with literature, we do not normalize the stocks by the total capital stock, but by
the economically relevant capital (firms’ capital stock or houses) type. Thus, dividing
Equation ref:Lf by firms’ capital stock and making some algebraic manipulation, we
obtain steady growth loans’ ratio to firms’ capital stock (`? , Equation ref:firmratio ):

Introduction

ignore

In this Section, we present the results of the following experiments: (i) wage-share
decrease; (ii) house price inflation; (iii) deposits interest rate increase. In order to
evaluate if our model is able to reproduce some stylized facts, we introduce U.S. houses
own rate of interest observed data (from 1992 to 2019) into our numerical simulation.
Before we move foward, it is worth mentioning that we use *fazzari-2020-deman-led’s
citeyear:fazzari-2020-deman-led parameter values calibrated for the U.S. economy
for a similar time range (from 1980 to 2016). Our first experiment assess if income
distribution has a level effect on output — as in cite:mandarino-2020-worker-debt
— or growth rate effect — as in cite:brochiersupermultiplier2018 . Real estate inflation
increase experiment is motivated by recent US experience (from 1992 to 2019) as
discussed in Section ref:sec:empirical while the last simulation aims to evaluate indebtedness
stability. Table ?? in Appendix ref:append:Data presents the parameters of simulation
and Table ?? compare each result to baseline.

35

5.1.2

Wage-share decrease

A wage-share decrease has permanent negative impact on output level —
due to changes in the supermultiplier — and temporary negative effects on degree of
capacity utilization (see Figure ref:fig:results1 A). So, aggregate demand growth level
is temporarily smaller than baseline as a result of the lower supermultiplier. As a
consequence of this negative level effect, both accumulation growth rate and marginal
propensity to invest temporaly decline while NCC autonomous expenditures share on
GDP increases. Since NCC autonomous expenditures growth rate remains unchanged
and its share on GDP increases, aggregate demand grows faster than accumulation
rate. As a result, degree of capacity utilization is higher than the normal one. During
the traverse, marginal propensity to invest endogenously adjust to discrepancies between
actual and normal capacity utilization rates. Consequently, non-residential investment
growth rate increases faster than aggregate demand. This endogenous adjustment
process continues as long as actual rate of capacity utilization is different from the
normal one. In summary, we report standards SSM model results: (i) marginal propensity
to invest decrease is temporally and returns to baseline level; (ii) rate of capacity
utilization moves towards normal one; (iii) supermultiplier decreases and autonomous
expenditures share increases due to GDP decline and; (iv) since autonomous expenditures
growth rate does not change, distribution effects on growth rates are temporary.
Despite temporary growth rate effects, wage-share decrease has a permanent
effect in house share on total capital stock (see Equation ref:klong and Figure ref:fig:results2
B). As a consequence of the initially lower accumulation rate, total capital stock also
36

grows at a temporarily lower rate. However, since residential investment growth rate
remains unchanged, its share on total capital stock increases.
Finally, we also report a persistent effect on firms’ balance sheet due to
wage-share decrease. The negative level effect on GDP implies an already mentioned
temporally decrease in marginal propensity to invest. As a consequence of the initially
lower accumulation rate and higher profit share, firms’ loan-to-capital ratio decrease.
Thus, according to Equation ref:Longnetprofitratio , gross and net profit rate remain
persistently close to each other (see Figure ref:fig:results2 D). Therefore, as profits
distribution policy remains the same, firms require less external funding so its indebtedness
decreases.

5.1.3

Real estate inflation increase

An increase of real estate inflation implies a higher residential investment
growth due to houses own rate of interest decrease. As a result, both GDP growth
rate and degree of capacity utilization increase as well. Since firms react to discrepancies
between actual and normal degree of capacity utilization rate, non-residential investment
growth rate is temporally higher than GDP growth rate due to marginal propensity
to invest adjustment. Furthermore, capitalists’ disposable income also increases as a
result of the already mentioned higher GDP growth rate. Since loans interest remains
unchanged, capitalists’ indebtedness ratio decreases. During the traverse, gross and
net profit rate are temporally close to each other as a result of profits level increase,
so firms’ indebtedness decreases as well. Therefore, similar to textcite:mandarino-2020-worker-debt,
37

we also report paradox of debt.
In summary, we report SSM standard long-run results: (i) GDP growth rate
converges to NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate; (ii) marginal propensity
to invest remains persistently higher compared to baseline and; (iii) utilization rate
moves gradually towards the normal one. As mentioned before, our model distinctiveness
is the existence of two types of capital stocks since households invest as well.
The most distinct result is real houses share decreases on total capital stock
as a result of residential investment growth rate increase. Although counterintuitive,
this result is similar to the conventional paradox of debt. This is the case since houses
are always equivalent to mortgage debt. Additionally, this result is in line with SSM
literature. Firms investment follows capital stock adjustment principle, so a higher
firms investment growth rate implies that GDP grows faster than residential investment.
Thus, both residential investment share on GDP and degree of capacity utilization
decrease. In other words, both autonomous expenditures share on GDP and houses
share on real assets decline as a result of the already described non-residential investment
positive reaction.

5.1.4

Interest rate increase

A increase in benchmark interest rate has a persistent effect on long-run
growth rate since houses own interest rate increases as well6 . Non-residential investment
6

Since we assume null spread on both mortgage and loans interest rate, an increase on deposits
interest rate also increases the other ones. As a consequence, banks’ net financial wealth remains

38

growth rate decreases as a result of residential investment growth rate permanent
decline, so houses share on real assets increases. Compared to the previous experiments,
this shock has opposite effects on long-run growth rates, NCC autonomous expenditure
share on GDP, utilization rate and marginal propensity to invest than the previous
one (see Figure ref:fig:results1 ).
In particular, we report a stronger negative effect over both capitalists’ and
firms’ balance sheet than wage-share decrease (see figures ref:fig:results1 and ref:fig:results2 ).
This effect is a result of the temporarily stronger decline of GDP growth rate compared
to NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate. As a consequence of lower GDP growth
rate, total profits also decreases. Thus, capitalists’ disposable income decreases more
than debt-financed consumption growth rate. Interest rate increase alone is enough
to capitalists’ indebtedness level to increase, however it is followed by GDP growth
rate decrease, so the overall effect is stronger than wage-share decrease experiment
(Section ref:sec:Exp1). Regarding firms’ balance sheet, we report a temporarily negative
level effect on gross profit rate and a permanent one on net profit rate. So, there is a
permanent increase in the gap between them due to increase in external funding and
to the negative level effect on profits. Therefore, we find a stable debt dynamics for
both capitalists and firms (other parameters remaining unchanged).

Plugging real data

Finally, we include houses own rate of interest data discussed in section
ref:sec:empirical (see Figure ref:propriainvesto ) into our model. In order to do so, each
year corresponds to ten simulated periods for visualization reasons. Additionally, we
have abandoned the assumption of a fixed share (R) between residential investment
and capitalist consumption. In order to include capitalists consumption without running
41

into asymptotic paths, we defined its growth rate as the geometric average of residential
investment growth rate from 1992 to 2019.
Although rudimentary, this procedure allows us to replicate some stylized
facts presented in section ref:sec:empirical and in the literature (see Figure ref:fig:Realresults1 ).
Similarly to Figure ref:fig:cycles, we report a clockwise relationship between autonomous
expenditure share on GDP and rate of capacity utilization. With due mediation,
we also report a smooth gravitation of capacity utilization ratio towards the normal
one. As expected, NCC autonomous expenditures (notably residential investment)
describes accumulation and GDP growth rate. Together these results provide a first
step towards the connection between house bubbles and aggregate demand within the
Sraffian Supermultiplier framework.

Concluding remarks
Concluding Remarks

ignore

This paper contributes to demand-led growth agenda, taking in consideration
recent efforts of embedding it in a SFC framework. Our novelty is the introduction
of residential investment determined by houses own rate of interest in a SSM-SFC
model. Residential investment has beeen included due to recent empirical works showing
its relevance for macroeconomic dynamics. Houses’ own rate of interest allowed us to
connect house bubbles with aggregate demand in a rather parsimonious way.
Our model reports standard results of Sraffian Supermultiplier: (i) utilization
rate converges to the normal one through changes on firms’ marginal propensity to
invest; (ii) GDP growth rate converges to NCC autonomous expenditure growth rate
and; (iii) income distribution affects growth rate only during the traverse. A particular
feature of our model is the dual composition of capital stock: firms’ capacity creating
and real estate. The most distinct result is the decrease of houses share on capital
stock due to the increase of residential investment growth rate. Although counterintuitive,
this occurs because firms react to the discrepancies between actual and desired utilization
rates. In other words, for capacity utilization converges to the normal one, firms’
investment needs to grow temporarily faster than residential investment, changing
the ratio between houses and total capital stock in the long-run.
Future research should increase the complexity of this model in order to
43

understand other consequences of residential investment. Some extensions could be
exploring other determinants of its growth rate and its effects on banks’ net financial
wealth. This emerging “housing agenda” should also moves towards institutional grounds.
For example, future research could assess which institutional arrangements allow/inhibit
the connection between house bubble, credit granting/rationing and financial instability.
Nevertheless, this is a little step in a wider research agenda on the role of residential
investment for economic growth and business cycles.
