<

<

< 𝑝−1
< 
< ∆𝐘𝑡 = Π𝐘𝑡−1 + ∑ Г𝑖 ∆𝐘𝑡−i + 𝑒𝑡 ,
< 𝑖=1
< 
< testing the null of no causality at frequency zero is interesting, since in this special case
< Θ(𝑒 0 ) = Θ1 − I + Θ2 +. . . +Θp = Π, which is called the impact matrix. Testing the null

< 𝑝−1
< 
< 𝑝−1
< 
< ∆𝑥𝑡 = 𝜇11 𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝜇12 𝑦𝑡−1 + ∑ 𝛾11𝑖 ∆𝑥𝑡−𝑖 + ∑ 𝛾12𝑖 ∆𝑦𝑡−𝑖 + 𝑒1𝑡 ,
< 𝑖=1
< 
< (11)
< 
< 𝑖=1
< 
< where 𝜇 and 𝛾 denote the (𝑖, 𝑗) element of Π and Г𝑘 , respectively. Testing 𝜇12 = 0 is
< equivalent to testing long-run causality (Pittis, 1999).
< If in the bivariate cointegrating system 𝑥 is integrated of order 0 and 𝑦 is integrated
< of order 1, the Wald test for the hypothesis 𝜇12 = 0 does not have a standard limiting
