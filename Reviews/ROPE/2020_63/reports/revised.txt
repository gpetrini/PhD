Housing is NOT ONLY the Business Cycle: A Luxemburg-Kalecki
External Market Empirical Investigation for the United States

Abstract: We study the residential investment-economic activity nexus in the United
States during the period 1960–2020. We find evidence of symmetric and asymmetric
frequency-domain Granger causality running unidirectionally from residential investment
(RES) to output. This unidirectional causal relationship is both permanent and transitory:
transitory shocks in RES have transitory effects on GDP, while permanent shocks in RES
have permanent effects on GDP. Our results validate the hypothesis of Fiebiger (2018)
and Fiebiger and Lavoie (2019), who state that housing investment in the US can be
analogous to a Luxemburg-Kalecki external market. Our findings can also be read
through the lenses of the recent autonomous demand-led growth literature. In particular,
we single out a specific component of autonomous demand and describe its prominent
role in the US variety of capitalism Thus, we conclude that residential investment, despite
constituting a small overall share of GDP, is not only the cycle but is also the trend of the
US economy.

1. Introduction
In the title of his famous article, Leamer (2007) stated that “Housing IS the
Business Cycle.” He documented that the dynamics of residential investment (RES from
now on) has played and is still playing a central role in explaining the business cycles in
the United States during the post-WWII era. Leamer also suggested that, with very few
exceptions, recessions can be predicted by analyzing the dynamics of RES. Thus, a
reduction of the RES/GDP ratio would always precede a recession, while the growth of
the RES/GDP ratio would always precede a recovery in the United States (see Figure 1).

on the Y-Axis; while the X-Axis displays the span of time (1960:Q1-2015:Q1).
In recent years, and especially in the aftermath of the global economic crisis of
2008, several research projects have studied the influence of RES on macroeconomic
performance. Most of these works are mainly empirical and are consistent with the
neoclassical approach to the determination of prices and output. However, some recent
works have studied the interaction between RES and growth from a demand-led, i.e.,
Keynesian, perspective. We argue that, in this framework, those models that focus on the
role played by the autonomous components of demand (more on this later) in driving
growth—such as the Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) developed by Serrano (1995), Bortis
(1997), and Dejuan (2005), and some recent versions1 of the neo-Kaleckian model—are
a promising benchmark for studying the relationship between RES, economic activity,
and growth.

If, following an endogenous credit money approach—as in Palley (1997), Fontana
and Setterfield (2009), Cesaratto (2016), and Deleidi and Fontana (2020), among others—
one considers that RES is mostly funded through external sources of finance, such as the
extension of credit through the creation of new money, it follows that RES’s course is not
mechanically linked to the pace of production income and of capital accumulation, as
Serrano (1995) anticipated.2 Thus, the banking system creates ex nihilo purchasing power
that requires no abstinence on the part of other agents (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 256).
This allows us to establish a link also with the Luxemburg-Kalecki external market
(Luxemburg 1913; Kalecki, 1968, 1971) concept and the literature stemming from it, such
as Fiebiger (2018) and Fiebiger and Lavoie (2019). As it has been recently recalled in
Cesaratto (2015), to which we refer for a deeper discussion, in his 1967 article Kalecki
draws on a prescient Rosa Luxemburg’s intuition according to which consumption and
investment are not sufficient to absorb an economy’s surplus and external (to the circuit
of production income) markets 3 are needed for this purpose. On this basis, Kalecki comes
to argue that external markets can be considered as the engine of growth, an engine that
also drives the evolution of investment in capital goods.
The main aim of this work is to go a step beyond Leamer (2007, 2015) and show
that RES dynamics can be considered a driver of both cycles and long-run growth in the
United States, as predicted by theoretical models such as the SSM and some recent
contributions in the neo-Kaleckian tradition. In terms of a time-series empirical analysis,
this assertion suggests the existence of both short- and long-run Granger causality running
unidirectionally from RES to output. We investigate whether these Granger causal
relationships exist. As we will explain, however, this article is not meant to provide a
complete and thorough test of autonomous demand-led growth models; instead, we only
test if and to what extent the dynamics of RES influences (in the Granger sense) the
dynamics of production income and whether the former is autonomous (in the Granger
sense) with respect to the latter.

2

According to Serrano (1995) and the following literature, autonomous demand comprises and is
constituted by “All those expenditures that are not financed by wage income generated by production
decisions, nor affect (directly) the productive capacity of the economy” (Serrano, 1995: 71).
3
Among the external markets we can include exports, government spending and all those expenditures
financed by changes in the position of agents' net financial assets (expenditure of money previously
obtained or creation of new credits) and not by current income, such as residential investment.
3

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the works that test the
relationship between RES and economic activity. In Section 3, we briefly introduce a class
of models that stress the role of autonomous demand as a driver of economic growth,
which will provide the analytical interpretative tool for our empirical findings. In Section
4, we explain the econometrics methodology used in this research. We also explain its
benefits: (i) it allows testing symmetric and asymmetric relationships between the
variables; (ii) it allows testing permanent and transitory Granger causality relationships;
and (iii) it is robust to structural changes and parameter instability in the relationships
among the variables. Finally, Section 5 presents our empirical results, while Section 6
concludes the article.
2. Empirical Literature on the Housing-Economic Activity Nexus
Several works have analyzed whether the strong affirmations of Leamer (2007)
(“Housing IS the Business Cycle”) and Leamer (2015) (“Housing Really Is the Business
Cycle”) find empirical support. Some papers seem to empirically validate Leamer’s
assertions, while others seem to refute them. However, most of the literature does not
focus directly on RES; instead, it uses proxies of housing activity, such as housing starts,
housing permits, and housing prices (see Huang et al., 2020). In general, these works
consider housing supply indicators and analyze how they affect macroeconomic
variables. To avoid spurious causality between housing and economic activity, they
control for supply factors (user costs, borrowing constraints, etc.) and other elements
generally related to monetary shocks (interest rate).
Goodhart and Hofmann (2008) find evidence of a multidirectional link between
house prices, monetary variables, and the macroeconomic activity for 17 industrialized
countries. Ghent and Owyang (2010) assess the relationship between housing variables
and employment over the business cycle in a set of 51 US cities, finding no evidence that
housing permits or housing prices influence the business cycle. Musso et al. (2011) state
that housing demand has a strong role in transmitting monetary policy shocks in the US.
Similarly, Cesa-Bianchi (2013) suggests that house price shocks are quickly transmitted
to the domestic real economy, leading to a short-run expansion of real GDP and consumer
prices in the world economy. Jordà et al. (2016) show that contemporary business cycles
are increasingly shaped by the dynamics of mortgage credit for 17 advanced economies
since 1870, which supports the growing importance of housing and housing finance for
4

the overall economy. Huang et al. (2018) point out that housing factors, such as housing
starts and housing prices, autonomously drive the business cycle in the US. Similarly,
Ren and Yuan (2014) focus on the leading role of housing indicators on macroeconomic
activity for the US.
Research on the macroeconomic implications of residential investment in terms
of volume—the housing output produced for the market—is much scarcer (Kohlscheen
et al., 2018: 2). Most of these works are generally informed by the neoclassical approach
to growth and distribution and, thus, consider economic growth to be supply-led. Just to
mention few examples, Kydland et al. (2016) state that RES leads output, whereas
nonresidential investment lags output in the US; nevertheless, these authors emphasize
that RES by itself is not capable of driving business cycles, since it is determined by
changes in nominal interest rates. Thus, housing variables are simply channels through
which monetary policy propagates. Similarly, Kohlscheen et al. (2018) find that
information on residential investment growth consistently improves the performance of
the yield curve as a predictor of recessions across nine OECD countries.
On the other hand, also authors in the Keynesian tradition have dealt with similar
research questions. Within Marxian strands (but with Keynesian longings), Sherman
(2010), suggests that housing investment is the leading indicator of United States’ real
economy activity. Arestis and González-Martínez (2015) study the forces that interact in
the real estate market of OECD countries, indicating that real disposable income is a key
element of the affordability of housing and act as the major determinant of real residential
investment (Arestis and González-Martínez 2015: 465); while Arestis and Zhang (2020)
suggest that, in China, the real estate sector is the main field of fixed investment and the
key driver of the nation’s GDP growth.4
The strand of works that investigate the housing-economic growth nexus in terms
of volume is more relevant to our research because we work under the hypothesis that
economies tend to be demand-led and that RES can be considered a potentially
autonomous component of final aggregate demand, as suggested by Fiebiger and Lavoie
(2019). For this reason, the class of Keynesian models that emphasize autonomous

4

On the other hand, Arestis and Gonzalez-Martinez (2019) study the relationship between housing and the
labour markets, focusing on the role of labor precariousness.
5

demand as the main driver of long-run growth will be the interpretative tool upon which
we will base our empirical analysis.
On the other hand, and rather unsurprisingly, most of the mainstream literature,
even when considering RES in terms of volume and as an exogenous component of
demand, maintain that its dynamics can only explain the cycle, not the secular tendency
of output.5 We offer a different theoretical point of view. Our main hypothesis is that a
non-wage source of effective demand such as RES, which is based on mortgage and
credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving growth in the long
run. Thus, we do not narrow our attention to the short run but consider also the long-run
nexus between the dynamics of RES and output in the US.
Inspired by Fiebiger (2018), Fiebiger and Lavoie (2019), and Petrini and Teixeira
(2020)—and by the autonomous demand-led growth literature in general—in the
following sections we investigate the role of residential investment not only in the US
business cycles, but also as a driver of long-run growth, in a context where the borrowing
capacity of households has been relatively autonomous with respect to income in the long
run.
3. Autonomous Demand-Led Growth Models as a Tool for Studying the Nexus
between RES and GDP Growth
In recent years, (broadly speaking) Keynesian growth theory has yielded a class
of models that point to the role of autonomous demand in driving economic growth.6
Since we believe that these analytical constructs are a promising tool for studying the
RES-economic activity nexus, we provide a brief overview.7 The starting point can be
found in the Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM), inaugurated by Serrano (1995). In his
attempt to develop an alternative theory of production and long-run accumulation,
Serrano builds upon two main staples: (i) the validity of the Keynesian-Kaleckian
principle of effective demand in the long run; and (ii) the compatibility of this approach

5

Huang et al. (2018) is an exception.
The autonomous demand-led growth literature is in line with several non-mainstream economics strands,
such as Duesenberry’s (1949) relative income hypothesis, the endogenous money approach and the
Luxemburg-Kalecki external markets literature (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 247).

the issue.

to the determination of quantities with the Classical Surplus approach to the theory of
value and distribution, revived by Sraffa (1960) (Serrano, 1995: 67), which implies
considering income distribution an exogenous variable and, therefore, rejecting any
mechanical link between distribution and economic growth.
The main message of the SSM is that long-run output growth tends to be driven
by the evolution of the non-capacity-generating autonomous components of demand. In
the long run, effective demand determines normal productive capacity, while autonomous
demand generates induced consumption (through the multiplier) and induced (capacitycreating) investment (through the accelerator) (Serrano, 1995: 67). Indeed, in this model,
firms continuously and gradually attempt to reach the normal (cost-minimizing) rate of
capacity utilization, so the system is in equilibrium and reaches its fully-adjusted position
when capacity is utilized normally. This mechanism operates through a flexible
accelerator mechanism, in which investment is treated as induced by the dynamics of
output. Very similar conclusions can be drawn from more recent amended versions of the
neo-Kaleckian model, such as Allain (2015) and Lavoie (2016),8 where in the long-run
the growth rate of the economy converges to the autonomous demand growth rate and
capacity utilization tends to its normal rate. 9
The expenditures that should be considered non-capacity-creating autonomous
demand, according to the SSM approach, include: “the consumption of capitalists; the
discretionary consumption of richer workers that have some accumulated wealth and
access to credit; residential “investment” by households; firms discretionary expenditures
that do not include the purchase of produced means of production such as consultancy
services, research & development, publicity, executive jets, etc.; government expenditure
(both consumption and investment); and total exports (both of consumption and of capital
goods since the latter do not create capacity within the domestic economy)” (Serrano,
1995: 71).

8

See Palley (2019) and Fazzari, et al. (2020), which introduce into this framework an explicit consideration
of labor market dynamics. See also Hein (2018) for a model depicting an economy whose growth is driven
by the evolution of autonomous government expenditures, but without convergence to normal utilization.
9
Fiebiger and Lavoie (2019) and Petrini and Teixeira (2020) explicitly explain how the SSM adjustment
mechanism can give insight into how cycles and secular trends are determined by the dynamics of
dwellings.
7

Since autonomous demand represents financial dis-saving and is financed to a
large extent through debt, the SSM approach ties in with the endogenous money approach
and the credit-creating powers of banks (Cesaratto, 2016, 2017). Thus, as highlighted by
Cesaratto (2015) and Fiebiger (2018), debt-financed expenditures, while internal to the
dynamics of a private capitalist economy, are analogous to an external market, as defined
by Rosa Luxemburg and Michał Kalecki (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 254).
If one considers that RES, being mostly financed out of credit, evolves largely
independently from production income10 and, at the same time, it is not destined to
increase productive capacity (Freitas and Serrano, 2015: 261), then RES can be treated as
a non-capacity-creating autonomous component of demand that drives long-run growth.
Indeed, we work under the hypothesis, which will be submitted to empirical scrutiny in
the next section, that this demand component affects the evolution of output without being
mechanically influenced by the latter. These two characteristics make RES suitable for
the inclusion among the possible determinant of long-run growth in a SSM framework.11
Although the SSM approach explicitly considers residential investment as
potential driver of growth (see also Cesaratto et al., 2003, p. 42), according to Petrini &
Teixeira (2020) this feature has not yet been incorporated into a demand-led growth
model. The aim of our research is to fill this gap. In this sense, our work complements
other attempts such as Nah and Lavoie (2017), Deleidi and Mazzucato (2019), Deleidi
and Mazzucato (2019), Deleidi et al. (2020), and Mandarino et al. (2020), where the
authors single out and study the contribution of specific components of autonomous
demand.12
With this in mind, we analyze the short- and long-run relationship between RES
and output in the US. To consistently analyze the RES- GDP nexus within the
“autonomous demand-led growth” approach, we consider a multivariate setting and
control for the variables that, according to the related literature, constitute other potential

10

See also Duesenberry (1958) on this. The American economist also emphasizes the role played by
speculative investment in disconnecting the dynamics of residential investment from that of production
income. This provides a possible theoretical explanation for the non-linear nature of the relationship
between the two variables, a feature confirmed by our empirical findings in section 5.
11
A supermultiplier mechanism is capable of giving insight into the effects of secular trends in dwelling
investment on the secular growth rate (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 248).

The first article of the list deals with exports, the three following papers focus on government innovation
expenditures, while the last one considers a growth model led by debt-financed consumption of workers.

components of autonomous demand, such as public expenditure, G; exports, E; and
research and development expenditures, RD (see Médici, 2011; Girardi and Pariboni,
2016; Perez-Montiel & Manera, 2020a, b; and Deleidi and Mazzucato, 2019). The
working hypothesis, based on the theoretical insights that can be derived from the
literature reviewed in this section, is that we expect to find confirmation of a positive
influence of RES growth on the dynamics of aggregate output. In terms of the empirical
analysis we develop in the next sections, this amounts to positive and significant
coefficients for the independent variable (RES) in the cointegrating equation.
A final, important, comment is in order. Pedagogically, the class of models we
briefly referred to in this section provides an accessible and coherent story on how
expenditures originating in the household, government, or foreign sectors can stabilize as
well as drive growth processes (see Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019). However, the canonical
versions of these models do not consider explicit financial relations and constraints; thus,
few would defend their strict empirical realism (See Skott (2017a, b) for a critique of the
empirical validity of these models, together with Lavoie's (2017) reply).
The consideration of debt-financed expenditure is undoubtedly complex, since it
constitutes a non-wage and non-profit source of effective demand that carries numerous
complexities from debt servicing (Setterfield and Kim, 2016). Hence, we do not try to
provide a complete and thorough validation of autonomous demand-led growth models
here. We do not deal with the very important issue of how residential investment is
financed either, even though we recognize that the investigation of financial dynamics is
the necessary complement of non-capacity creating autonomous demand-led growth
models, as recently and persuasively claimed in Hein and Woodgate (2020). The aim of
this paper is more modest: we investigate only whether RES can empirically be considered
an autonomous driver of final demand, both in the short and in the long run.
4. Data and Methodology
In the next sections, we empirically analyze the relationship between the dynamics
of RES and GDP within a SSM-inspired approach. To this end, we apply the nonlinear
auto-regressive distributive lag model (NARDL) of Shin et al. (2014), together with the
Granger causality in the frequency domain test of Breitung and Candelon (2006). As we
explain in Section 4.4, we adopt this methodology in order to overcome several
9

weaknesses of standard Granger causality tests, so that the results of our analysis, given
the asymmetric framework we use, are not affected by parameter instability or undetected
structural breaks. Moreover, the frequency-domain Granger causality approach also
allows us to discriminate between short- and long-run Granger causality relationships
among our variables of interest.
4.1. Data
We employ quarterly series between 1960:Q1 and 2019:Q2. We choose the period
1960-2019 because, as Girardi and Pariboni (2016) show, the supermultiplier was broadly
stable in the US from the sixties onwards. For the proxy variable for output, we use the
evolution of the gross domestic product, GDP. For the proxy variable for residential
investment, we use fixed residential investment, RES. Additionally, we consider other
potential components of autonomous demand, such as public expenditure, G; exports, E;
and research and development expenditures, RD.13 For G, we use the variable real
government consumption expenditures and gross investment. To represent E, we employ
the variable real exports of goods and services. As a proxy for RD, we use the variable
research and development expenditures (see Table 1 for the summary statistics of them).
We work with the variables in real terms (measured in billions of chained 2012 dollars,
seasonally adjusted annual rate) and transform them into logarithms for consistent and
reliable

empirical

results.

4.2. Unit Root Test
To apply the asymmetric-spectral Granger causality test employed in this
research, we first need to know the degree of integration of the variables (mainly to make
sure that none of them is a I(2) process). Thus, we first check for the stationarity of the
variables GDP, RES, G, E, and RD. A non-stationary series that needs to be differenced d
times to become stationary is integrated of order d, i.e., is a I(d) process. We apply the
Breakpoint Unit Root test of Perron (1997), which is robust to an unknown structural
change. The test considers various methods of selecting the break points and the

13

We do not include in this list consumer credit-financed expenditures. In doing this, we follow Girardi
and Pariboni (2016), who find consumer credit to be influenced by the economic cycle and hence not
suitable for consideration as an autonomous component of demand.
10

asymptotic and finite sample distributions of the corresponding statistics (Perron, 1997:
355). The methodology of the Perron (1997) unit root test with breakpoint is widely
known; therefore, for reasons of space, we do not describe it here.
4.3. The Asymmetric Relationship between Output and Residential
Investment
In this section, we consider the relationship between GDP and RES in a nonlinear
framework. Since the literature has widely recognized that macroeconomic variables and
processes have nonlinear structures, the information obtained from linear models might
not be enough to make reliable predictions (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Bliss and
Shiller, 1995; and Cooper and Shiller, 2000, among others). This is likely to be the case
in the relationship between GDP and RES, highly governed by the financial environment.
Shin et al. (2014) warn that the assumption of linear adjustments may be too restrictive
in many economically interesting situations, especially where transaction costs are
important and where policy interventions are observed in-sample, stressing that
nonlinearities are endemic in the social sciences and that asymmetry is fundamental to
the human condition. Keynes (1936: 314) himself stated that “the substitution of a
downward for an upward tendency often takes place suddenly and violently, whereas
there is, as a rule, no such sharp turning point when an upward is substituted for a
downward tendency.”
In this section, we employ the nonlinear auto-regressive distributive lag model
(NARDL) of Shin et al. (2014) to investigate the presence of a relationship between GDP
and RES in the US. The nonlinear ARDL model of Shin et al. (2014) is preferred to other
nonlinear methods, since this model allows us to simultaneously consider both short- and
long-run asymmetries. Indeed, the Markov-switching vector error correction model (MSVECM), developed by Hamilton (1989) and continued by Krolzig (1997) and Psaradakis
et al. (2004), and the smooth transition regression error correction model, developed by
Kapetanios et al. (2006), do not allow detection of asymmetry in the long run. On the
other hand, the threshold framework, developed by Enders and Siklos (2001), accounts
only for long-run asymmetry.
The NARDL, developed by Shin et al. (2014), has been discussed in recent works
such as Alsamara et al. (2017), Ivanovski and Churchill (2019), Al-mulali et al. (2019),
11

and Bahmani-Oskooee and Gelan (2019), among others; thus, we only display the basic
details of the method. As stated, Shin et al. (2014) propose a nonlinear ARDL model that
considers asymmetries, developing a flexible dynamic parametric framework to model
relationships that exhibit combined long- and short-run asymmetries. This implies that
the explicative variable, 𝑥, is decomposed into its positive and negative partial sums:
𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥0 + 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝑥𝑡− ,

(1)

where 𝑥𝑡+ = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 ∆𝑥𝑗+ = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 max (∆𝑥𝑗 , 0) and 𝑥𝑡− = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 ∆𝑥𝑗− = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 min (∆𝑥𝑗 , 0)
are the partial sum processes that accumulate positive and negative changes in 𝑥𝑡
(Granger and Yoon, 2002; Shahzad et al., 2017). Thus, the model considers the following
asymmetric long-run regression:
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛽+ 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑡− + 𝑢𝑡 ,

(2)

where 𝛽 + and 𝛽− are the asymmetric long-run parameters associated with positive and
negative changes in 𝑥𝑡 . If 𝛽 + = 𝛽 −, there is a symmetric effect of 𝑥 on 𝑦. If 𝛽 + > 0 and
𝛽 − > 0, this implies that an increase in 𝑥 increases 𝑦, and a decrease in 𝑥 decreases 𝑦.
This means that there are two possible scenarios: either 𝛽 + > 𝛽− or 𝛽− > 𝛽+ . The former
suggests that there is a positive effect on 𝑦 caused by an increase in 𝑥, which exceeds the
negative impact on 𝑦 caused by a comparable decline in 𝑥. The latter situation indicates
that a decrease in 𝑥 has a larger negative effect on 𝑦 than the positive effect from an
increase in 𝑥. Shin et al. (2014) combined Equation (2) with the conventional ARDL(p,q)
approach of Pesaran et al. (2001), obtaining the following nonlinear ARDL model:

where 𝑥𝑡 is a k×1 vector of multiple regressors, defined so that 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥0 + 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝑥𝑡−, 𝜃𝑗 is
the autoregressive parameter, 𝜇𝑗+′ and 𝜇𝑗−′ are the asymmetric distributed-lag parameters,
and 𝜀𝑡 is an independent and identically distributed process with zero mean and constant
variance, 𝜎𝜀2 . Following Pesaran et al. (2001), Equation (3) can be represented by the
following asymmetric error correction model:

for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑞 − 1; and ECT𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝛽+ 𝑥𝑡+ − 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑡− is the nonlinear error correction
term where 𝛽 + = − 𝜑𝑥+ /𝜑𝑦 and 𝛽 − = − 𝜑𝑥− /𝜑𝑦 are the asymmetric long-run
coefficients. The long-run asymmetry is represented by 𝜑 + and 𝜑 − . The short-run
asymmetry is represented by 𝛼𝑗+ and 𝛼𝑗− . We test the long-run asymmetry through a Wald
test with the null hypothesis that 𝜑 + = 𝜑 − . We test the short-run symmetry through a
Wald test of the null hypothesis that 𝛼𝑗+ = α−
j ∀𝑖.
4.4. Frequency-Domain Granger Causality Test
As stated in Section 4.3, economic events, such as changes in the economic
environment, changes in monetary and/or fiscal policy, etc., can create room for a
nonlinear (rather than linear) relationship between RES and GDP. This nonlinearity may
also arise due to frictions in the economy and/or asymmetric information flow, which
leads to market inefficiency (Tiwari, 2012: 1573). In fact, it is important to note that one
of the key assumptions of Granger causality tests, both in time and in frequency-domains,
is that of parameter stability, i.e., the parameters in equations relating the variables do not
change over the sample under consideration (Gupta et al., 2015: 803). Since we consider
a relatively long span of time (1960:Q1-2019:Q2), it is likely that the relationship between
GDP, RES, G, E, and RD suffers from structural breaks. However, unlike with symmetric
causality testing, the results of the asymmetric causality tests are not affected by
parameter instability/structural breaks, since they control for any bias that parameter
instability would cause (Ranjbar et al., 2017: 27). Thus, we analyze the issue of Granger
causality between RES and GDP in an asymmetric framework.
With insights from Hatemi-J (2012), Toumi and Toumi (2019), and Kumar et al.
(2019), we investigate asymmetric causality relationships between RES and GDP by
incorporating the partial sum decompositions of Equation (1) (𝑥𝑡+ and 𝑥𝑡− ) using the
13

augmented vector autoregression (VAR) in level approach developed by Toda and
Yamamoto (1995). However, instead of implementing the single test statistic in the time
domain, which assumes that the causal relationship holds for all points in the frequency
distribution, we use the frequency-domain Granger causality test of Breitung and
Candelon (2006). Thus, with insights from Ranjbar et al. (2017), Chang et al. (2017), and
Saliminezhad and Bahramian (2020), we combine the time-domain-asymmetric Granger
causality framework with the symmetric-frequency-domain Granger causality approach.
Since spectral causality is defined by the spectral density of the “effect” variable,
frequency-wise measures are nonlinear functions of the parameters of the vector
autoregressive regression (VAR) model. However, Breitung and Candelon (2006)
developed a spectral Granger causality test that is easier to implement. The test can
identify whether a particular component of the “cause” variable at frequency 𝜔 is useful
for predicting the component of the “effect” variable at the same frequency one period
ahead (Tastan, 2015: 1158).
The details of the methodology developed by Breitung and Candelon (2006) have
recently been applied and discussed in regard to studying Granger causal relationships
between macroeconomic variables in works such as Krätschell and Schmidt (2017),
Fromentin and Tadjeddine (2019), Bouri et al. (2019), and Manera et al. (2020). Thus,
we only display the primary conclusions of the method in the Appendix, stating that
Granger causality between RES and GDP can be tested at any frequency 𝜔 between 0 and
𝜋.
Breitung and Candelon (2006) suggest that the Toda and Yamamoto (1995)
approach can also be used for the frequency domain test (see the Appendix). The Toda
and Yamamoto (1995) approach to causality is considered an upgraded version of the
Wald test. The method obtains efficient and consistent estimates even when the variables
have different orders of integration. The Toda and Yamamoto (1995) model is constructed
through a VAR in levels. In our research, the VAR specification would be as follows:

where 𝐴1 - 𝐴𝑘 are 9x9 matrices of coefficients with 𝐴0 as an identity matrix, 𝑒𝑠 are the
disturbance terms (assumed to have zero mean and constant variance), and 𝑘 = 𝑝 + 𝑑max ,
where 𝑝 is the lag length of the system and 𝑑max is the maximum order of integration that
the variables need to become stationary. The null hypothesis of no Granger causality
running from RES+ to GDP at a frequency ω (MRES+→GDP (𝜔)) involves only 𝛾𝑖 , 𝑖 =
1, . . . , 𝑝 (where 𝛾𝑖 are the coefficients of RES + in Equation 5), which implies that the
coefficients of the additional lagged variables are not included in the computation of the
Wald statistic. The H0 can be tested by means of the F-test, which follows an F(𝑝, T −
2𝑝) distribution for every 𝜔 between 0 and 𝜋.
5. Empirical Results
In this section, we present the empirical results of our research. We implement the
nonlinear ARDL test of Shin et al. (2014) and the symmetric- and asymmetric-frequencydomain Granger causality test of Breitung and Candelon (2006), using the modified Wald
test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995).

The first step of our research is to investigate the degree of integration of the
variables through the Breakpoint Unit Root test of Perron (1997). The test suggests that
the variables are integrated of order one (Table 2).

Notes: This table presents the Perron (1997) unit root test statistics. ∆ denotes first difference. The asterisks *, **, and
*** denote rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root process at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance level,
respectively. The break specification is intercept and trend, and the type of break is an innovational outlier. The lag
length is selected by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of Schwarz (1978).

Tables 3 and 4 report the results of the nonlinear ARDL test of Shin et al. (2014).
The lag selection is carried out following the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) of
Akaike (1974) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of Schwarz (1978). The lag
length of the ARDL specification is validated by the absence of serial correlation in the
residuals through the Breusch-Godfrey Lagrange multiplier test, which tests the null
hypothesis that the errors are serially independent (see Breusch, 1978 and Godfrey, 1998).
Additionally, the diagnostic tests reveal that there is no misspecification in the short- and
long-run estimates, the non-normality of the error term, the serial correlation, and
heteroscedasticity.

Notes: This table display the results of the vector error correction model derived from the NARDL of Shin et al. (2014)
(Equation (4)). ∆ denotes first difference. The asterisks *** indicate statistical significance at the 1% significance level. The
lag order specification is adopted by the AIC and BIC. We also present the results of the short-run asymmetry test between
the effects of ∆RES + and ∆RES − . The asterisks *** indicate rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetry at the 1% level.

On the other hand, in Table 4 we see that the long-run coefficients of RES + and
RES − carry their theoretically expected positive and significant coefficients, but we are
not sure if the coefficients are significantly different from each other. To determine if this
difference is statistically significant, we apply the standard F-test on the null hypothesis
that 𝛽 + = 𝛽− , while the null hypothesis of short-run asymmetry is described by
∑𝑞𝑖=0 𝛼𝑗+ = ∑𝑟𝑖=0 𝛼𝑗−. In Tables 3 and 4 we see that the F-tests are significant, which
17

implies rejecting the null hypothesis of symmetry both in the short and in the long run.
Thus, RES has asymmetric short- and long-run effects on GDP. Asymmetries are
important, since, in our case, they indicate that cyclical upturns and downturns in RES
have asymmetrical effects on economic activity. For example, Table 4 shows that the
estimated long-run coefficients of RES − are higher than those of RES +. It implies that, in
the long run, a decrease in RES has a stronger impact on economic activity than a
proportionally equal increase in RES.

Notes: This table presents the coefficients of the long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables under study
(Equation 2). The asterisks *** indicate statistical significance the 1% significance level. We also present the results
of the long-run asymmetry test between the effects of RES + and RES −. The asterisks *** indicate rejection of the
null hypothesis of symmetry at the 1% level.

The calculated long-run effects are only meaningful in the presence of
cointegration. In Table 3 we observe that the coefficient of the lagged error correction
term (ECT𝑡−1 ) is negative and statistically significant. Thus, following the Engle and
Granger (1987) approach, we conclude that a significant and negative coefficient for
ECT𝑡−1 supports the existence of cointegration between GDP, RES, G, E, and RD. A
significant and negative coefficient for ECT𝑡−1 does not only indicate convergence, but
also the speed of adjustment to equilibrium. Thus, there is a nonlinear cointegrating
relationship between the variables at the 1% significance level.
The existence of cointegration indicates that our proposed model is analytically
valid, since, if there exists a cointegrating relationship between a set of nonstationary
variables, the same cointegrating relationship also exists in an extended variable space
(Johansen, 2000). The presence of cointegration avoid finding spurious Granger causality

18

relationships and justifies the non-inclusion of additional variables, which would
unnecessarily increase the number of cointegrating equations that would have to be
identified and estimated (Herzer and Nunnenkamp, 2012: 253; Perez-Montiel and
Manera, 2020a: 227).
Once we have confirmed that the variables follow a long-run equilibrium
relationship, we implement the Breitung and Candelon (2006) frequency-domain Granger
causality test using the modified Wald test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). Since the unit
root tests suggest that the variables are I(1) processes, we establish 𝑑max =1. Following
Toda and Yamamoto (1995) and Breitung and Candelon (2006), we fit a
VAR(p+𝑑max ) model in levels, but implement the test using 𝑝 lags. We also include a
time trend in the VAR system.
We test for symmetric and asymmetric Granger causality by also considering the
partial sum decompositions specified in Equation (2) in the Toda Yamamoto-Breitung
Candelon approach. Thus, we test for Granger symmetric causality relationships between
RES and GDP conditioning on G, E, and RD; for asymmetric Granger causality
relationships between RES + and GDP conditional on G+ , E +, RD+, RES −, G− , E − and
RD−; and, finally, for asymmetric Granger causality relationships between RES − and GDP
conditional on G+ , E +, RD+, RES +, G− , E − and RD−.
Following Ciner (2011), we test for Granger causality at high (𝜔=2.5) and low
(𝜔=0.05) frequencies. According to Ciner (2011), the causality test at high and low
frequency levels is equivalent to temporary (short-run) and permanent (long-run)
causality test, respectively. We run the test using different lag orders, 𝑝 (from 3 to 6, since
3 is the minimum number of lags necessary to get a sufficient dynamic structure in the
model to perform the frequency decomposition). 14 We run the frequency-domain Granger
causality tests using the Stata command bcgcausality developed by Tastan (2015).
Table 5 displays the results of the frequency-domain Granger causality tests. The
presence of Granger causality is examined at frequencies 0.05 and 2.5. Since long-run
dynamics or the secular trend are represented by lower spectral frequency components
and short-run linkages are represented by higher spectral frequency components, we

14

We are thankful to Jörg Breitung for this suggestion.
19

define these frequencies as long (0.05) and short (2.5) periodicities. Thus, despite relying
on a VAR in levels, the Toda Yamamoto-Breitung Candelon test can be used to study
whether the evolution of RES acts as a determinant of the secular trend of growth (see
Bodart and Candelon, 2009; Ranjbar et al., 2017; and Aluko et al., 2020, among others).
Table 5 shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no symmetric Granger
causality running from GDP to RES, conditional on G, E, and RD, at any significance level
for frequencies 0.05 and 2.5. However, we reject the null hypothesis of no Granger
causality running from RES to GDP at the 1% significance level for frequency 0.05. It
implies that the lower spectral components of RES (which represent the secular trend of
RES) unidirectionally Granger cause the lower spectral components of GDP. We also
reject the null hypothesis of no Granger causality running from RES to GDP at the 1%
significance level for frequency 2.5. It suggests that the higher spectral components of
RES (which represent the short-run dynamics of RES) unidirectionally Granger cause the
lower spectral components of GDP. Overall, we conclude that permanent (transient)
shocks in RES Granger-cause permanent (transient) shocks in GDP; but not the other way
around. Thus, these results suggest both transitory and permanent symmetric Granger
causality running unidirectionally from RES to GDP.
In Table 5, we also present the results of the asymmetric-frequency-domain
Granger causality tests. In line with the symmetric Granger causality results, we observe
that the positive and negative decompositions have a unidirectional Granger causal effect
on output growth: Permanent (transient) positive (negative) shocks in RES Granger cause
permanent (transient) positive (negative) shocks in GDP; while shocks in GDP do not
Granger cause shocks in RES. The results presented in Table 5 indicate that there is
enough statistical information to confirm the existence of short- and long-run Granger
causality running unidirectionally from RES to GDP, suggesting that the dynamics of RES
leads the evolution of GDP both in the short and in the long run.
Overall, our results suggest that RES can be considered a driver of the secular
growth rate of the US economy; at the same time, RES has determined the business cycle
in the US since the sixties. Our results are in accordance with those papers that conclude
that housing determines the business cycle (despite, as described in Section 2, most of
these papers does not consider residential investment in volumes) and with those of

20

Arestis and Zhang (2020). On the other hand, our results differ from those of Huang et al.
(2020), who also employ a frequency-domain framework but in orthodox strands.

This table shows the results of the frequency-domain Granger causality tests. We report the p-values corresponding to
the estimated Wald test statistic for the null hypothesis of no symmetric Granger causality running from RES(GDP) to
GDP(RES), conditional on G, E, and RD (first column). We also report the results of asymmetric-frequency-domain
Granger causality running from RES +(GDP) to GDP(RES +), conditional on G + , E + , RD+ , RES −, G−, E −, and RD−
(second column); and from RES −(GDP) to GDP(RES −), conditional on G+, E + , RD+ , RES + , G− , E − , and RD− (third
column). We employ different lag lengths, p, (from 3 to 6). We test Granger causality at frequency ω=0.05 and ω=2.5.
The asterisks *** and ** denote rejection of the null hypothesis of no Granger causality at the 1% and 5% significance
level.

As a side result, the data in Tables 4 and 5 allow us to relate our findings with the
autonomous demand-led growth literature. According to this literature, at the theoretical
level, the whole of autonomous demand is the driving force of output in the long run. In
this paper, we have shown that in the US during the time span considered, a prominent
role has been played by a specific component of autonomous demand: residential
investment. It does not seem too far-fetched to interpret this as a specific feature of
American capitalism and its growth process, which are heavily based on credit to
households.
6. Concluding Remarks
A growing body of Keynesian literature sees autonomous demand as the main
driver of long-run growth, as prescribed by models such as the Sraffian supermultiplier
and some variants of the neo-Kaleckian model. Our contribution belongs to this line of
research, inasmuch we single out a specific component of autonomous demand and
investigate its prominent role in the US variety of capitalism.
21

In this article, we have highlighted the role of residential investment as a driver
of both the cycle and secular growth in the US. The main methodological novelty of our
contribution is the combination of the asymmetric time-domain Granger causality
approach with the spectral Granger causality framework, which provides an empirical
strategy that allows testing for asymmetric frequency-domain Granger causality
relationships between the variables. We found that the lower spectral components of RES
(which represent long-run dynamics of RES) and the higher spectral components of RES
(which represent short-run dynamics of RES) unidirectionally Granger cause the lower
and the higher spectral components of GDP. Thus, we have found evidence of symmetric
and asymmetric Granger causality running unidirectionally from residential investment
to GDP, both in the short and in the long run. This implies that the dynamics of RES
predict the dynamics of output both in the short and in the long run.
According to Cesaratto (2015) and Fiebiger (2018), residential investment, while
internal to the dynamics of a private capitalist economy, can be analogous to a
Luxemburg-Kalecki external market. Our research provides an empirical validation for
this assertion for the US economy, since we find evidence that the dynamics of residential
investment drive the evolution of output, while the output does not exert any significant
influence on the evolution of the residential investment. Thus, we conclude that
residential investment, despite constituting a small overall share of GDP, is not only the
cycle but is also the trend of the US economy.
Appendix. Breitung and Candelonʼs (2006) methodology
Following Breitung and Candelonʼs (2006) notation, let us consider 𝐘t = (𝑥𝑡 , 𝑦𝑡 )′
a time series vector with stationary covariance. It can be described by a VAR(p) process
such as

𝚯(L)𝐘t = 𝜺𝑡 ,

(1)

where 𝚯(L) = 𝐈2 − 𝚯1 L − 𝚯2 L2 − … − 𝚯p Lp is a 2×2 lag polynomial with the backshift
operator Li 𝐘t = 𝐘t−i ; 𝐈2 represents a 2×2 identity matrix; 𝚯i with i =1 ,2,...,p denotes a
2×2 coeﬃcient matrix associated with lag i; and 𝜺𝑡 is a vector white-noise process with
E(𝜀𝑡 )=0 and positive-deﬁnite covariance matrix 𝚺 = E(𝜺𝒕 𝜺𝒕 ′). After Cholesky
22

factorization, 𝐆′𝐆 = 𝚺 −1 (where 𝐆 is a lower-triangular matrix), a moving-average
representation of the system in (5) can be represented as
Φ (L) Φ𝟏𝟐 (L) 𝜀𝟏𝒕
Ψ (L)
𝐘𝑡 = 𝚽(L)𝜺𝑡 = [ 𝟏𝟏
] [𝜀 ] = 𝞇(L)𝞰𝒕 = [ 𝟏𝟏
Φ𝟐𝟏 (L) Φ𝟐𝟐 (L) 𝟐𝒕
Ψ𝟐𝟏 (L)

Ψ𝟏𝟐 (L) 𝜂𝟏𝒕
] [ ],
Ψ𝟐𝟐 (L) 𝜂𝟐𝒕

where 𝞰𝒕 = 𝐆𝜺𝑡 ; E(𝞰𝒕 , 𝞰′𝒕 ) = I; 𝚽(L) = Θ(L)−1; and 𝞇(L) = 𝚽(L)G−1.
The causality running from 𝑥 to y at frequency 𝜔 can be measured, following
Geweke (1982), as

M𝑥→𝑦 (𝜔) = log [1 +

|Ψ12 (𝑒 −𝑖𝜔)|

2

|Ψ11 (𝑒 −𝑖𝜔)|

2

].

(2)

The condition Ψ12 (𝑒 −𝑖𝜔 ) = 0 implies no Granger causality from 𝑥 to 𝑦 at frequency .
Breitung and Candelon (2006) show that this condition is satisfied if the condition
𝑝

𝑝

|Θ12 (𝑒 −𝑖𝜔 )| = |∑ 𝜃𝑘,12 cos(𝑘𝜔) − 𝑖 ∑ 𝜃𝑘,12 sin(𝑘𝜔)| = 0
𝑘=1

(3)

𝑘=1

is also satisfied, where 𝜃𝑘,12 is the (1,2) element of 𝚯𝑘 . In this framework, the necessary
and sufficient conditions for no causality are
𝑝

∑ 𝜃𝑘,12 cos(𝑘𝜔) = 0,

(4)

𝑘=1

and
𝑝

∑ 𝜃𝑘,12 sin(𝑘𝜔) = 0.

(5)

𝑘=1

To simplify the notation, following Breitung and Candelon (2006), let’s denote
𝛾𝑘 = 𝜃𝑘,11 and 𝛽𝑘 = 𝜃𝑘,12, and write the following VAR equation:

𝑦𝑡 = γ1 𝑦𝑡−1 +. . . +γ𝑝 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 + 𝛽1 𝑥𝑡−1 +. . . +𝛽𝑝 𝑥𝑡−p + 𝑒1𝑡 .

23

(6)

The null hypothesis of no causality M𝑥→𝑦 (𝜔) = 0 is equivalent to the linear restriction
′
cos(𝜔)
H0 : R(𝜔)𝛽 = 0, where 𝛽 is [𝛽1 , . . . , 𝛽𝑝 ] and R(𝜔) is [
sin(𝜔)

cos(2𝜔) … cos(p𝜔)
].
sin(2𝜔) … sin(p𝜔)

According to Breitung and Candelon (2006), in a cointegrating system such as
𝑝−1

∆𝐘𝑡 = Π𝐘𝑡−1 + ∑ Г𝑖 ∆𝐘𝑡−i + 𝑒𝑡 ,
𝑖=1

testing the null of no causality at frequency zero is interesting, since in this special case
Θ(𝑒 0 ) = Θ1 − I + Θ2 +. . . +Θp = Π, which is called the impact matrix. Testing the null
of no causality at frequency zero in a cointegrating system would imply testing 𝜇12 =
0 in the following regression:
𝑝−1

𝑝−1

∆𝑥𝑡 = 𝜇11 𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝜇12 𝑦𝑡−1 + ∑ 𝛾11𝑖 ∆𝑥𝑡−𝑖 + ∑ 𝛾12𝑖 ∆𝑦𝑡−𝑖 + 𝑒1𝑡 ,
𝑖=1

where 𝜇 and 𝛾 denote the (𝑖, 𝑗) element of Π and Г𝑘 , respectively. Testing 𝜇12 = 0 is
equivalent to testing long-run causality (Pittis, 1999).
If in the bivariate cointegrating system 𝑥 is integrated of order 0 and 𝑦 is integrated
of order 1, the Wald test for the hypothesis 𝜇12 = 0 does not have a standard limiting
distribution (Sims et al., 1990). Similar problems are faced in higher-dimensional systems
if a block of the matrix Π is singular (Breitung and Candelon, 2006: 368). Breitung and
Candelon (2006) suggested that the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) method can be used to
overcome this difficulty.
