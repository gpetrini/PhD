Residential Investment as a Luxemburg-Kalecki External Market in
the United States: An Empirical Investigation

2020-63

Abstract: We study the residential investment-economic activity nexus in the United
States during the period 1960–2020. We employ an asymmetric Granger causality test
based on the frequency domain. The combination of the asymmetric and the spectral
analysis is robust to structural changes in the relationship among the variables and allows
for both positive and negative shocks over different horizons. We find evidence of
symmetric and asymmetric frequency-domain Granger causality running unidirectionally
from residential investment (RES) to output. This unidirectional causality relationship is
both permanent and transitory: transitory shocks in RES have transitory effects on GDP,
while permanent shocks in RES have permanent effects on GDP. Our results validate the
hypothesis of Fiebiger (2018) and Fiebiger and Lavoie (2019), who state that housing
investment in the US can be analogous to a Luxemburg-Kalecki external market. Thus,
we highlight the role of residential investment as a driver of both the business cycle and
the secular growth in the US.

1. Introduction
In the title of his famous article, Leamer (2007) stated that “Housing IS the
Business Cycle.” He documented that the dynamics of residential investment (RES from
now on) has played and is still playing a central role in explaining the business cycles in
the United States during the post-WWII era. Leamer also suggested that, with very few

1

exceptions, recessions can be predicted by analyzing the dynamics of RES. Thus, a
reduction of the RES/GDP ratio would always precede a recession, while the growth of
the RES/GDP ratio would always precede a recovery in the United States.
In recent years, and especially in the aftermath of the global economic crisis of
2008, several research projects have studied the influence of RES on macroeconomic
performance. Most of these works are mainly empirical and are consistent with the
neoclassical approach to the determination of prices and output. However, some recent
works have studied the interaction between RES and growth from a demand-led, i.e.,
Keynesian, perspective. We argue that in this framework, those models that focus on the
role played by the autonomous components of demand (more on this later) in driving
growth—such as the Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) developed by Serrano (1995), Bortis
(1997), and Dejuan (2005), and some recent versions1 of the neo-Kaleckian model—are
a promising benchmark for studying the relationship between RES, economic activity,
and growth. In this article, we argue, in particular, that with these analytical tools one can
go a step beyond Leamer (2007, 2015) and establish that RES not only drives US cycles,
but contributes to the long-run path of the economy.
If, following an endogenous credit money approach—as in Palley (1997), Fontana
and Setterfield (2009), Cesaratto (2016), and Deleidi and Fontana (2020), among others—
one considers that RES is mostly funded through external sources of finance, such as the
extension of credit through the creation of new money, it follows that RES’s course is
independent from the pace of output and of capital accumulation. Thus, the banking
system creates ex nihilo purchasing power that requires no abstinence on the part of other
agents (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 256). This allows us to establish a link with the
Luxemburg-Kalecki external market (Luxemburg 1913; Kalecki, 1968, 1971) intuition
and the literature stemming from it, such as Fiebiger (2018) and Fiebiger and Lavoie
(2019). In this sense, the exercise we propose in this article can be considered an attempt
to provide an empirical validation of the theses of these contributions.
The main aim of this work is to show that RES dynamics can be considered a
driver of both cycles and long-run growth in the United States, as predicted by theoretical
models such as the SSM and some recent contributions in the neo-Kaleckian tradition. In

terms of a time-series empirical analysis, this assertion suggests the existence of both
short- and long-run Granger causality running unidirectionally from RES to output. We
investigate whether these causal relationships exist. In Section 2, we review the works
that test the relationship between RES and economic activity. In Section 3, we briefly
introduce a class of models that stress the role of autonomous demand as a driver of
economic growth, which will provide the analytical interpretative tool for our empirical
findings. In Section 4, we explain the econometrics methodology used in this research.
We also explain its benefits: (i) it allows testing symmetric and asymmetric relationships
between the variables; (ii) it allows testing permanent and transitory causality
relationships; and (iii) it is robust to structural changes and parameter instability in the
relationships among the variables. Finally, Section 5 presents our empirical results, while
Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Empirical Literature on the Housing-Economic Activity Nexus
Several works have analyzed whether the strong affirmations of Leamer (2007)
(“Housing IS the Business Cycle”) and Leamer (2015) (“Housing Really Is the Business
Cycle”) find empirical support. Some papers seem to empirically validate Leamer’s
assertions, while others seem to refute them. However, most of the literature does not
focus directly on RES; instead, it uses proxies of housing activity, such as housing starts,
housing permits, and housing prices. In general, these works consider housing supply
indicators, and analyze how they affect macroeconomic variables. To avoid spurious
causality between housing and economic activity, they control for supply factors (user
costs, borrowing constraints, etc.) and other elements generally related to monetary
shocks (interest rate).
Goodhart and Hofmann (2008) find evidence of a multidirectional link between
house prices, monetary variables, and the macroeconomic activity for 17 industrialized
countries. Ghent and Owyang (2010) assess the relationship between housing variables
and employment over the business cycle in a set of 51 US cities, finding no evidence that
housing permits or housing prices influence the business cycle. Musso et al. (2011) state
that housing demand has a strong role in transmitting monetary policy shocks in the US.
Similarly, Cesa-Bianchi (2013) suggests that house price shocks are quickly transmitted
to the domestic real economy, leading to a short-run expansion of real GDP and consumer
prices in the world economy. Jordà et al. (2016) show that contemporary business cycles
3

are increasingly shaped by the dynamics of mortgage credit for 17 advanced economies
since 1870, which supports the growing importance of housing and housing finance for
the overall economy. Huang et al. (2018) point out that housing factors, such as housing
starts and housing prices, autonomously drive the business cycle in the US. Similarly,
Ren and Yuan (2014) focus on the leading role of housing indicators on macroeconomic
activity for the US.
On the other hand, research on the macroeconomic implications of residential
investment in terms of volume—the housing output produced for the market—is much
scarcer (Kohlscheen et al., 2018: 2). Arestis and González-Martínez (2015) indicate that
residential investment is influenced by real disposable income in the US and in other
OECD countries. However, Kydland et al. (2016) state that RES leads output, whereas
nonresidential investment lags output in the US; nevertheless, these authors emphasize
that RES by itself is not capable of driving business cycles, since it is determined by
changes in nominal interest rates. Thus, housing variables are simply channels through
which monetary policy propagates. On the other hand, Kohlscheen et al. (2018) find that
information on residential investment growth consistently improves the performance of
the yield curve as a predictor of recessions across nine OECD countries. Similarly, Arestis
and Zhang (2020) suggest that in China, the real estate sector is the main field of fixed
investment and the key driver of the nation’s GDP growth.
The second strand of works—those that investigate the housing-economic growth
nexus in terms of volume—is more relevant to our research, since, as we will explain in
Section 3, we consider RES a potentially autonomous component of final aggregate
demand. There are some exceptions but most of these works are generally informed by
the neoclassical approach to growth and distribution, and, thus, consider economic growth
to be supply-led. Some of these works consider RES an exogenous component of demand;
but, since growth is supply-led in their research framework, the dynamics of RES can only
explain the cycle, not the secular growth rate. Thus, with the exception of Huang et al.
(2018), they only study whether RES can explain business cycles.
We consider the housing-growth nexus under a different theoretical framework,
upon which we base our empirical analysis. Inspired by Fiebiger (2018), Fiebiger and
Lavoie (2019), and Petrini and Teixeira (2020)—and by the autonomous demand-led
growth literature in general—we will investigate the role of residential investment not
4

only in business cycles in the US, but also as a driver of long-run growth, in a context
where the borrowing capacity of households has been relatively autonomous with respect
to income in the long run. Therefore, we do not narrow our attention to the short run (as
most of the vast literature we briefly summarized does) but consider the long-run nexus
between the dynamics of RES and output growth in the US.
3. Autonomous Demand-Led Growth Models as a Tool for Studying the Nexus
between RES and GDP Growth
In recent years, (broadly speaking) Keynesian growth theory has yielded a class
of models that point to the role of autonomous demand in driving economic growth. Since
we believe that these analytical constructs are a promising tool for studying the RESeconomic activity nexus, we provide a brief overview.2 The starting point can be found
in the Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM), inaugurated by Serrano (1995). In his attempt to
develop an alternative theory of production and long-term accumulation, Serrano builds
upon two main staples: (i) the validity of the Keynesian-Kaleckian principle of effective
demand in the long run; and (ii) the compatibility of this approach to the determination
of quantities with the Classical Surplus approach to the theory of value and distribution,
revived by Sraffa (1960) (Serrano, 1995: 67), which implies considering income
distribution an exogenous variable and, therefore, rejecting any mechanical link between
distribution and economic growth.
The main message of the SSM is that output growth tends to be driven by the
growth of the non-capacity-generating autonomous components of demand. According
to Serrano (1995) and the following literature, autonomous demand comprises and is
constituted by “All those expenditures that are not financed by wage income generated
by production decisions, nor affect (directly) the productive capacity of the economy”
(Serrano, 1995: 71). In the long run, effective demand determines normal productive
capacity, while autonomous demand generates induced consumption (through the
multiplier) and induced (capacity-creating) investment (Serrano, 1995: 67). Indeed, in
this model, firms continuously and gradually attempt to reach the normal (costminimizing) rate of capacity utilization, so the system is in equilibrium when capacity is
utilized normally. This mechanism operates through a flexible accelerator mechanism, in
The interested reader can refer to Freitas and Serrano (2015) and Lavoie (2016) for in-depth treatments of
the issue.

which investment is treated as induced by the dynamics of output. Very similar
conclusions can be drawn from more recent amended versions of the neo-Kaleckian
model, such as Allain (2015) and Lavoie (2016).3
The expenditures that should be considered as non-capacity-creating autonomous
demand, according to the SSM approach, include: “the consumption of capitalists; the
discretionary consumption of richer workers that have some accumulated wealth and
access to credit; residential “investment” by households; firms discretionary expenditures
that do not include the purchase of produced means of production such as consultancy
services, research & development, publicity, executive jets, etc.; government expenditure
(both consumption and investment); and total exports (both of consumption and of capital
goods since the latter do not create capacity within the domestic economy)” (Serrano,
1995: 71).
Since autonomous demand represents financial dis-saving and is financed to a
large extent through debt, the SSM approach ties in with the endogenous money approach
and the credit-creating powers of banks (Cesaratto, 2016, 2017). Thus, as highlighted by
Cesaratto (2015) and Fiebiger (2018), debt-financed expenditures, while internal to the
dynamics of a private capitalist economy, are analogous to an external market, as defined
by Rosa Luxemburg and Michał Kalecki (Fiebiger and Lavoie, 2019: 254).
If one considers that RES evolves largely independently from output and, at the
same time, it is not destined to increase productive capacity (Freitas and Serrano, 2015:
261), then RES can be treated as a non-capacity-creating autonomous component of
demand that drives long-run growth. Although the SSM approach explicitly considers
residential investment as potential driver of growth, according to Petrini & Teixeira
(2020), this feature has not yet been incorporated into a demand-led growth model. The
aim of our research is to fill this gap. In this sense, our work complements other attempts
such as Nah and Lavoie (2017), Deleidi and Mazzucato (2019), Deleidi and Mazzucato
(2019) and Deleidi et al. (2020), where the authors single out and study the contribution
of specific components of autonomous demand. 4

See Palley (2019) and Fazzari, et al. (2020), which introduce into this framework an explicit consideration
of labor market dynamics. See also Hein (2018) for a model depicting an economy whose growth is driven
by the evolution of autonomous government expenditures, but without convergence to normal utilization.
4 The first article of the list deals with exports, the other three with government innovation expenditures.
3

6

With this in mind, we analyze the short- and long-run relationship between RES
and economic growth in the US. In this way, we single out a specific component of
autonomous demand that plays a prominent role in the US capitalism. To consistently
analyze the RES- GDP nexus with the “autonomous demand-led growth” approach, we
consider a multivariate setting and control for the variables that, according to the related
literature, constitute other potential components of autonomous demand, such as public
expenditure, G; exports, E; and research and development expenditures, RD (see Médici,
2011; Girardi and Pariboni, 2016; and Perez-Montiel & Manera, 2020a, b; and Deleidi
and Mazzucato, 2019).
A final, important comment is in order. Pedagogically, the class of models we
briefly referred to in this section provides an accessible and coherent story on how
expenditures originating in the household, government, or foreign sectors can stabilize as
well as drive growth processes. However, the canonical versions of these models do not
consider explicit financial relations and constraints; thus, few would defend their strict
empirical realism.5 The consideration of debt-financed expenditure is undoubtedly
complex, since it constitutes a non-wage and non-profit source of effective demand that
carries numerous complexities from debt servicing (Setterfield and Kim, 2016). Hence,
we do not try to provide a complete and thorough validation of autonomous demand-led
growth models here. We do not deal with the very important issue of how residential
investment is financed either, even though we recognize that the investigation of financial
dynamics is the necessary complement of non-capacity creating autonomous demand-led
growth models, as recently and persuasively claimed in Hein and Woodgate (2020). The
aim of this paper is more modest: we investigate only whether RES can empirically be
considered an autonomous driver of final demand and growth, both in the short and in the
long run.
4. Data and Methodology
In the next sections, we empirically analyze the relationship between the dynamics
of RES and economic growth within a SSM-inspired approach. To this end, we apply the
nonlinear auto-regressive distributive lag model (NARDL) of Shin et al. (2014), together
with the Granger causality in the frequency domain test of Breitung and Candelon (2006).
See Skott, 2017a, b for a critique of the empirical validity of these models, together with Lavoie's (2017)
reply.

As we explain in Section 4.4, we adopt this methodology in order to overcome several
weaknesses of standard Granger causality tests, so that the results of our analysis, given
the asymmetric framework we use, are not affected by parameter instability or undetected
structural breaks. Moreover, the frequency-domain causality approach also allows us to
discriminate between short- and long-run effects between our variables of interest.
4.1. Data
We employ quarterly series between 1960:Q1 and 2019:Q2. For the proxy
variable for economic activity, we use the evolution of the gross domestic product, GDP.
For the proxy variable for residential investment, we use fixed residential investment,
RES. Additionally, we consider other potential components of autonomous demand, such
as public expenditure, G; exports, E; and research and development expenditures, RD. For
G, we use the variable real government consumption expenditures and gross investment.
To represent E, we employ the variable real exports of goods and services. As a proxy for
RD, we use the variable research and development expenditures. We work with the
variables in real terms (measured in billions of chained 2012 dollars, seasonally adjusted
annual rate) and transform them into logarithms for consistent and reliable empirical
results.
4.2. Unit Root Test
To apply the asymmetric-spectral Granger causality test employed in this
research, we first need to know the degree of integration of the variables. Thus, we first
check for the stationarity of the variables GDP, RES, G, E, and RD. A non-stationary series
that needs to be differenced 𝑑 times to become stationary is integrated of order 𝑑, i.e., is
a I(𝑑) process. We apply the Breakpoint Unit Root test of Perron (1997), which is robust
to an unknown structural change. The test considers various methods of selecting the
break points and the asymptotic and finite sample distributions of the corresponding
statistics (Perron, 1997: 355). The methodology of the Perron (1997) unit root test with
breakpoint is widely known; therefore, for reasons of space, we do not describe it here.

4.3. The Asymmetric Relationship between Output and Residential
Investment
In this section, we consider the relationship between GDP and RES in a nonlinear
framework. Since the literature has widely recognized that macroeconomic variables and
processes have nonlinear structures, the information obtained from linear models might
not be enough to make reliable predictions. Keynes (1936: 314) himself stated that “the
substitution of a downward for an upward tendency often takes place suddenly and
violently, whereas there is, as a rule, no such sharp turning point when an upward is
substituted for a downward tendency.” Shin et al. (2014) warn that the assumption of
linear adjustments may be too restrictive in many economically interesting situations,
especially where transaction costs are important and where policy interventions are
observed in-sample. These authors note that the fields of behavioral finance and
economics (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Bliss and Shiller, 1995; and Cooper and
Shiller, 2000, among others) have stressed that nonlinearity is endemic in the social
sciences and that asymmetry is fundamental to the human condition.
In this section, we employ the nonlinear auto-regressive distributive lag model
(NARDL) of Shin et al. (2014) to investigate the presence of a relationship between GDP
and RES in the US. The nonlinear ARDL model of Shin et al. (2014) is preferred to other
nonlinear methods, since this model allows us to simultaneously consider both short- and
long-run asymmetries. Indeed, the Markov-switching vector error correction model (MSVECM), developed by Hamilton (1989) and continued by Krolzig (1997) and Psaradakis
et al. (2004), and the smooth transition regression error correction model, developed by
Kapetanios et al. (2006), do not allow detection of asymmetry in the long run. On the
other hand, the threshold framework, developed by Enders and Siklos (2001), accounts
only for long-run asymmetry.
The NARDL, developed by Shin et al. (2014), has been discussed in recent works
such as Alsamara et al. (2017), Ivanovski and Churchill (2019), Al-mulali et al. (2019),
and Bahmani-Oskooee and Gelan (2019), among others; thus, we only display the basic
details of the method. As stated, Shin et al. (2014) propose a nonlinear ARDL model that
considers asymmetries, developing a flexible dynamic parametric framework to model
relationships that exhibit combined long- and short-run asymmetries. This implies that
the explicative variable, 𝑥, is decomposed into its positive and negative partial sums:
9

𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥0 + 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝑥𝑡− ,

(1)

where 𝑥𝑡+ = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 ∆𝑥𝑗+ = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 max (∆𝑥𝑗 , 0) and 𝑥𝑡− = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 ∆𝑥𝑗− = ∑𝑡𝑗=1 min (∆𝑥𝑗 , 0)
are the partial sum processes that accumulate positive and negative changes in 𝑥𝑡
(Granger and Yoon, 2002; Shahzad et al., 2017). Thus, the model considers the following
asymmetric long-run regression:
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛽+ 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑡− + 𝑢𝑡 ,

(2)

where 𝛽 + and 𝛽− are the asymmetric long-run parameters associated with positive and
negative changes in 𝑥𝑡 . If 𝛽 + = 𝛽 −, there is a symmetric effect of 𝑥 on 𝑦. If 𝛽 + > 0 and
𝛽 − > 0, this implies that an increase in 𝑥 increases 𝑦, and a decrease in 𝑥 decreases 𝑦.
This means that there are two possible scenarios: either 𝛽 + > 𝛽− or 𝛽− > 𝛽+ . The former
suggests that there is a positive effect on 𝑦 caused by an increase in 𝑥, which exceeds the
negative impact on 𝑦 caused by a comparable decline in 𝑥. The latter situation indicates
that a decrease in 𝑥 has a larger negative effect on 𝑦 than the positive effect from an
increase in 𝑥. Shin et al. (2014) combined Equation (2) with the conventional ARDL(p,q)
approach of Pesaran et al. (2001), obtaining the following nonlinear ARDL model:

𝑦𝑡 = ∑ 𝜃𝑗 𝑦𝑗−𝑖 + ∑(𝜇𝑗+′ 𝑥𝑡−𝑗

𝑗=0

where 𝑥𝑡 is a k×1 vector of multiple regressors, defined so that 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥0 + 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝑥𝑡−, 𝜃𝑗 is
the autoregressive parameter, 𝜇𝑗+′ and 𝜇𝑗−′ are the asymmetric distributed-lag parameters,
and 𝜀𝑡 is an independent and identically distributed process with zero mean and constant
variance, 𝜎𝜀2 . Following Pesaran et al. (2001), Equation (3) can be represented by the
following asymmetric error correction model:

for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑞 − 1; and ECT𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝛽+ 𝑥𝑡+ − 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑡− is the nonlinear error correction
term where 𝛽 + = − 𝜑𝑥+ /𝜑𝑦 and 𝛽 − = − 𝜑𝑥− /𝜑𝑦 are the asymmetric long-run
coefficients. The long-run asymmetry is represented by 𝜑 + and 𝜑 − . The short-run
asymmetry is represented by 𝛼𝑗+ and 𝛼𝑗− . We test the long-run asymmetry through a Wald
test with the null hypothesis that 𝜑 + = 𝜑 − . We test the short-run symmetry through a
Wald test of the null hypothesis that 𝛼𝑗+ = α−
j ∀𝑖.
4.4. Frequency-Domain Granger Causality Test
As stated in Section 4.3, economic events, such as changes in the economic
environment, changes in monetary and/or fiscal policy, etc., can create room for a
nonlinear (rather than linear) relationship between RES and GDP. This nonlinearity may
also arise due to frictions in the economy and/or asymmetric information flow, which
leads to market inefficiency (Tiwari, 2012: 1573). In fact, it is important to note that one
of the key assumptions of Granger causality tests, both in time and in frequency-domains,
is that of parameter stability, i.e., the parameters in equations relating the variables do not
change over the sample under consideration (Gupta et al., 2015: 803). Since we consider
a relatively long span of time (1960:Q1-2019:Q2), it is likely that the relationship between
GDP, RES, G, E, and RD suffers from structural breaks. However, unlike with symmetric
causality testing, the results of the asymmetric causality tests are not affected by
parameter instability/structural breaks, since they control for any bias that parameter
instability would cause (Ranjbar et al., 2017: 27). Thus, we analyze the issue of Granger
causality between RES and GDP in an asymmetric framework.
With insights from Hatemi-J (2012), Toumi and Toumi (2019), and Kumar et al.
(2019), we investigate asymmetric causality relationships between RES and GDP by
incorporating the partial sum decompositions of Equation (1) (𝑥𝑡+ and 𝑥𝑡− ) using the
augmented vector autoregression (VAR) approach developed by Toda and Yamamoto
(1995). However, instead of implementing the single test statistic in the time domain,
which assumes that the causal relationship holds for all points in the frequency
distribution, we use the frequency-domain Granger causality test of Breitung and
Candelon (2006), which is built on the previous works of Granger (1969), Geweke
11

(1982), and Hosoya (1991). Thus, with insights from Ranjbar et al. (2017), Chang et al.
(2017), and Saliminezhad and Bahramian (2020), we combine the time-domainasymmetric Granger causality framework with the symmetric-frequency-domain Granger
causality approach.
In contrast to the time-domain Granger causality analysis, which produces a
single, one-shot statistic regarding predictability, thereby describing a relationship
between the variables that is supposed to apply across all periodicities (in the short run,
over the business cycle frequencies, and in the long run), frequency domain or spectral
analysis decomposes the variability of a time series into different frequencies that
contribute to the fluctuations of the variable. Long-run dynamics are represented by lower
frequency components of the spectra, while short-run linkages are represented by higher
frequency components. Thus, it is assumed that the sensitivity of a variable to a temporary
(high-frequency) shock in another variable is not the same as that to a permanent (lowfrequency) shock.
Since spectral causality is defined by the spectral density of the “effect” variable,
frequency-wise measures are nonlinear functions of the parameters of the vector
autoregressive regression (VAR) model. However, Breitung and Candelon (2006)
developed a spectral Granger causality test that is easier to implement. The test can
identify whether a particular component of the “cause” variable at frequency 𝜔 is useful
for predicting the component of the “effect” variable at the same frequency one period
ahead (Tastan, 2015: 1158).
The details of the methodology developed by Breitung and Candelon (2006) have
recently been applied and discussed in regard to studying causal relationships between
macroeconomic variables in works such as Krätschell and Schmidt (2017), Fromentin
and Tadjeddine (2019), Bouri et al. (2019), and Manera et al. (2020). Thus, we only
display the primary conclusions of the method, stating that Granger causality between
RES and GDP can be tested at any frequency 𝜔 between 0 and 𝜋.
Following Breitung and Candelonʼs (2006) notation, let us consider 𝐘t = (𝑥𝑡 , 𝑦𝑡 )′
a time series vector with stationary covariance. It can be described by a VAR(p) process
such as

12

𝚯(L)𝐘t = 𝜺𝑡 ,

(5)

where 𝚯(L) = 𝐈2 − 𝚯1 L − 𝚯2 L2 − … − 𝚯p Lp is a 2×2 lag polynomial with the backshift
operator Li 𝐘t = 𝐘t−i ; 𝐈2 represents a 2×2 identity matrix; 𝚯i with i =1 ,2,...,p denotes a
2×2 coeﬃcient matrix associated with lag i; and 𝜺𝑡 is a vector white-noise process with
E(𝜀𝑡 )=0 and positive-deﬁnite covariance matrix 𝚺 = E(𝜺𝒕 𝜺𝒕 ′). After Cholesky
factorization, 𝐆′𝐆 = 𝚺 −1 (where 𝐆 is a lower-triangular matrix), a moving-average
representation of the system in (5) can be represented as
Φ (L) Φ𝟏𝟐 (L) 𝜀𝟏𝒕
Ψ (L)
𝐘𝑡 = 𝚽(L)𝜺𝑡 = [ 𝟏𝟏
] [ ] = 𝞇(L)𝞰𝒕 = [ 𝟏𝟏
Φ𝟐𝟏 (L) Φ𝟐𝟐 (L) 𝜀𝟐𝒕
Ψ𝟐𝟏 (L)

Ψ𝟏𝟐 (L) 𝜂𝟏𝒕
] [ ],
Ψ𝟐𝟐 (L) 𝜂𝟐𝒕

where 𝞰𝒕 = 𝐆𝜺𝑡 ; E(𝞰𝒕 , 𝞰′𝒕 ) = I; 𝚽(L) = Θ(L)−1; and 𝞇(L) = 𝚽(L)G−1.
The causality running from 𝑥 to y at frequency 𝜔 can be measured, following
Geweke (1982), as

M𝑥→𝑦 (𝜔) = log [1 +

The condition Ψ12 (𝑒 −𝑖𝜔 ) = 0 implies no Granger causality from 𝑥 to 𝑦 at frequency .

is also satisfied, where 𝜃𝑘,12 is the (1,2) element of 𝚯𝑘 . In this framework, the necessary

∑ 𝜃𝑘,12 sin(𝑘𝜔) = 0.

To simplify the notation, following Breitung and Candelon (2006), let’s denote
𝛾𝑘 = 𝜃𝑘,11 and 𝛽𝑘 = 𝜃𝑘,12, and write the following VAR equation:

𝑦𝑡 = γ1 𝑦𝑡−1 +. . . +γ𝑝 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 + 𝛽1 𝑥𝑡−1 +. . . +𝛽𝑝 𝑥𝑡−p + 𝑒1𝑡 .

(10)

The null hypothesis of no causality M𝑥→𝑦 (𝜔) = 0 is equivalent to the linear restriction
′
cos(𝜔)
H0 : R(𝜔)𝛽 = 0, where 𝛽 is [𝛽1 , . . . , 𝛽𝑝 ] and R(𝜔) is [
sin(𝜔)

cos(2𝜔) … cos(p𝜔)
].
sin(2𝜔) … sin(p𝜔)

According to Breitung and Candelon (2006), in a cointegrating system such as
𝑝−1

∆𝐘𝑡 = Π𝐘𝑡−1 + ∑ Г𝑖 ∆𝐘𝑡−i + 𝑒𝑡 ,
𝑖=1

testing the null of no causality at frequency zero is interesting, since in this special case
Θ(𝑒 0 ) = Θ1 − I + Θ2 +. . . +Θp = Π, which is called the impact matrix. Testing the null
of no causality at frequency zero in a cointegrating system would imply testing 𝜇12 =
0 in the following regression:
𝑝−1

𝑝−1

∆𝑥𝑡 = 𝜇11 𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝜇12 𝑦𝑡−1 + ∑ 𝛾11𝑖 ∆𝑥𝑡−𝑖 + ∑ 𝛾12𝑖 ∆𝑦𝑡−𝑖 + 𝑒1𝑡 ,
𝑖=1

(11)

𝑖=1

where 𝜇 and 𝛾 denote the (𝑖, 𝑗) element of Π and Г𝑘 , respectively. Testing 𝜇12 = 0 is
equivalent to testing long-run causality (Pittis, 1999).
If in the bivariate cointegrating system 𝑥 is integrated of order 0 and 𝑦 is integrated
of order 1, the Wald test for the hypothesis 𝜇12 = 0 does not have a standard limiting
distribution (Sims et al., 1990). Similar problems are faced in higher-dimensional systems
if a block of the matrix Π is singular (Breitung and Candelon, 2006: 368). Breitung and
Candelon (2006) suggested that the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) method can be used to
overcome this difficulty.

14

The Toda and Yamamoto (1995) approach to causality is considered an upgraded
version of the Wald test. The method obtains efficient and consistent estimates even when
the variables have different orders of integration. The Toda and Yamamoto (1995) model
is constructed through a VAR in levels. In our research, the VAR specification would be

where 𝑝 is the lag length, and 𝑑max is the maximum order of integration that the variables
need to become stationary. The null hypothesis of no causality running from RES + to
GDP at a frequency ω (MRES+ →GDP (𝜔)) involves only 𝛾11𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑝, which implies
that the coefficients of the additional lagged variables are not included in the computation
of the Wald statistic. The H0 can be tested by means of the F-test, which follows an
F(𝑝, T − 2𝑝) distribution for every 𝜔 between 0 and 𝜋.
5. Empirical Results
In this section, we present the empirical results of our research. We implement the
nonlinear ARDL test of Shin et al. (2014) and the symmetric- and asymmetric-frequencydomain Granger causality test of Breitung and Candelon (2006), using the modified Wald
test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995).

The first step of our research is to investigate the degree of integration of the
variables through the Breakpoint Unit Root test of Perron (1997). The test suggests that
the variables are integrated of order one (Table 2).

Notes: This table presents the Perron (1997) unit root test statistics. The asterisks *, **, and *** denote rejection of the
null hypothesis of a unit root process at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance level, respectively. The break specification
is intercept and trend, and the type of break is an innovational outlier. The lag length is selected by the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) of Schwarz (1978).

Tables 3 and 4 report the results of the nonlinear ARDL test of Shin et al. (2014).
The lag selection is carried out following the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) of
Akaike (1974) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of Schwarz (1978). The lag
length of the ARDL specification is validated by the absence of serial correlation in the
residuals through the Breusch-Godfrey Lagrange multiplier test, which tests the null
hypothesis that the errors are serially independent (see Breusch, 1978 and Godfrey, 1998).
Additionally, the diagnostic tests reveal that there is no misspecification in the short- and
long-run estimates, the non-normality of the error term, the serial correlation, and
heteroscedasticity.

Notes: This table display the results of the vector error correction model derived from the NARDL of Shin et al. (2014)
(Equation (4)). The asterisks *** indicate statistical significance at the 1% significance level. The lag order specification is
adopted by the AIC and BIC. We also present the results of the short-run asymmetry test between the effects of ∆RES + and
∆RES −. The asterisks *** indicate rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetry at the 1% level.

On the other hand, in Table 4 we see that the long-run coefficients of RES + and
RES − carry their theoretically expected positive and significant coefficients, but we are
not sure if the coefficients are significantly different from each other. To determine if this
difference is statistically significant, we apply the standard F-test on the null hypothesis
that 𝛽 + = 𝛽− , while the null hypothesis of short-run asymmetry is described by
∑𝑞𝑖=0 𝛼𝑗+ = ∑𝑟𝑖=0 𝛼𝑗−. In Tables 3 and 4 we see that the F-tests are significant, which
18

implies rejecting the null hypothesis of symmetry both in the short and in the long run.
Thus, RES has asymmetric short- and long-run effects on GDP. Asymmetries are
important, since, in our case, they indicate that cyclical upturns and downturns in RES
have asymmetrical effects on economic activity. For example, Table 4 shows that the
estimated long-run coefficients of RES − are higher than those of RES +. It implies that, in
the long run, a decrease in RES has a stronger impact on economic activity than a
proportionally equal increase in RES.

Notes: This table presents the coefficients of the long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables under study
(Equation 2). The asterisks *** indicate statistical significance the 1% significance level. We also present the results
of the long-run asymmetry test between the effects of RES + and RES −. The asterisks *** indicate rejection of the
null hypothesis of symmetry at the 1% level.

The calculated long-run effects are only meaningful in the presence of
cointegration. In Table 3 we observe that the coefficient of the lagged error correction
term (ECT𝑡−1 ) is negative and statistically significant. Thus, following the Engle and
Granger (1987) approach, we conclude that a significant and negative coefficient for
ECT𝑡−1 supports the existence of cointegration between GDP, RES, G, E, and RD. A
significant and negative coefficient for ECT𝑡−1 does not only indicate convergence, but
also the speed of adjustment to equilibrium. Thus, there is a nonlinear cointegrating
relationship between the variables at the 1% significance level.
The existence of cointegration indicates that our proposed model is analytically
valid, since, if there exists a cointegrating relationship between a set of nonstationary
variables, the same cointegrating relationship also exists in an extended variable space
(Johansen, 2000). The presence of cointegration avoid finding spurious causality

19

relationships and justifies the non-inclusion of additional variables, which would
unnecessarily increase the number of cointegrating equations that would have to be
identified and estimated (Herzer and Nunnenkamp, 2012: 253; Perez-Montiel and
Manera, 2020a: 227).
Once we have confirmed that the variables follow a long-run equilibrium
relationship, we implement the Breitung and Candelon (2006) frequency-domain Granger
causality test using the modified Wald test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). Since the unit
root tests suggest that the variables are I(1) processes, we establish 𝑑max =1. Following
Toda and Yamamoto (1995) and Breitung and Candelon (2006), we fit a
VAR(p+𝑑max ) model, but implement the test using 𝑝 lags. We also include a time trend
in the VAR system. We test symmetric and asymmetric causality by also considering the
partial sum decompositions specified in Equation 2 in the Toda Yamamoto-Breitung
Candelon approach. Thus, we test for symmetric causality relationships between RES and
GDP conditioning on G, E, and RD; for asymmetric causality relationships between RES +
and GDP conditional on G+ , E +, RD+, RES−, G− , E − and RD−; and, finally, for
asymmetric causality relationships between RES− and GDP conditional on G+ , E +, RD+,
RES +, G −, E − and RD−.
We run the test using different lag orders, 𝑝 (from 3 to 6, since 3 is the minimum
number of lags necessary to get a sufficient dynamic structure in the model to perform
the frequency decomposition).6 We run the frequency-domain Granger causality tests
using the Stata command bcgcausality by Tastan (2015).
Table 5 displays the results of the frequency-domain Granger causality tests. The
presence of Granger causality is examined at frequencies 0.05 and 2.5. These frequencies
are defined as long (0.05) and short (2.5) periodicities. At the same time, 𝜔 = 0.05 is
defined as permanent causality, whereas 𝜔 = 2.5 is defined as temporary causality (see
Bodart and Candelon, 2009). Table 5 shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of
no symmetric causality running from GDP to RES, conditional on G, E, and RD, at any
significance level for frequencies 0.05 and 2.5. On the other hand, we reject the null
hypothesis of no causality running from RES to GDP at the 1% significance level for
frequencies 0.05 and 2.5. These results suggest both transitory and permanent symmetric

In Table 5, we also present the results of the asymmetric-frequency-domain
Granger causality tests. In line with the symmetric causality results, we observe that the
positive and negative decompositions have a unidirectional causal effect on output
growth.

This table shows the results of the frequency-domain Granger causality tests. We report the p-values corresponding to
the estimated Wald test statistic for the null hypothesis of no symmetric Granger causality running from RES(GDP) to
GDP(RES), conditional on G, E, and RD (first column). We also report the results of asymmetric-frequency-domain
Granger causality running from RES +(GDP) to GDP(RES +), conditional on G + , E + , RD+ , RES −, G−, E −, and RD−
(second column); and from RES −(GDP) to GDP(RES −), conditional on G+, E + , RD+ , RES + , G− , E − , and RD− (third
column). We employ different lag lengths, p, (from 3 to 6). We test Granger causality at frequency ω=0.05 and ω=2.5.
The asterisks *** and ** denote rejection of the null hypothesis of no Granger causality at the 1% and 5% significance
level.

The results presented in Table 5 indicate that there is enough statistical information to
confirm the existence of short- and long-run Granger causality running unidirectionally
from the growth of RES to the growth of GDP, suggesting that the dynamics of RES leads
the evolution of GDP both in the short and in the long run. Overall, our results suggest
that RES can be considered a driver of the secular growth rate of the US economy. At the
same time, RES has determined the business cycle in the US since the sixties.
As a side result, the data in Tables 4 and 5 allow us to relate our findings with the
autonomous demand-led growth literature. According to this literature, at the theoretical
level, the whole of autonomous demand is the driving force of output growth in the long
run. In this paper, we have shown that in the US during the time span considered, a
21

prominent role has been played by a specific component of autonomous demand:
residential investment. It does not seem too far-fetched to interpret this as a specific
feature of American capitalism and its growth process, which are heavily based on credit
to households.
6. Concluding Remarks
In this article, we have highlighted the role of residential investment as a driver of
both the cycle and secular growth in the US. The main methodological novelty of our
contribution is the combination of the asymmetric time-domain causality approach with
the spectral causality framework, which provides an empirical strategy that allows testing
for asymmetric frequency-domain causality relationships between the variables. In this
way, we have found evidence of symmetric and asymmetric causality running
unidirectionally from the growth of residential investment to GDP growth, both in the
short and in the long run.
According to Cesaratto (2015) and Fiebiger (2018), residential investment, while
internal to the dynamics of a private capitalist economy, can be analogous to a
Luxemburg-Kalecki external market. Our research provides an empirical validation for
this assertion for the US economy, since we find evidence that the dynamics of residential
investment drive the evolution of output, while the output does not exert any significant
influence on the evolution of the residential investment. This allows us to relate our
contribution to the growing body of Keynesian literature on autonomous demand-led
growth. We single out a specific component of autonomous demand and describe its
prominent role in the US variety of capitalism. Thus, we conclude that residential
investment, despite constituting a small overall share of GDP, is not only the cycle but is
also the trend of the US economy.
