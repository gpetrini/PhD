	abstract = {The paper shows that the Sraffian Supermultiplier model provides an alternative closure for the analysis of the relationships between economic growth, income distribution, capacity utilization and effective demand in heterodox growth models. The new closure comes from the variability of the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save (herein called fraction), which is entailed by the assumption of the existence of (an independently growing) autonomous expenditures that do not generate capacity for the private sector. This variability allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the saving ratio without the need of changes in income distribution. If it is also assumed that changes in the marginal propensity to invest are induced by the competitive need to gradually adjust capacity to demand, this adjustment by means of endogenous changes in the fraction provides a closure that allows us to reconcile demand led growth, exogenous distribution and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization, even across steady states. A comparative analysis points out the distinctive features of this new clousure by contrasting its main results to the ones obtained with the closures associated to both the Cambridge and the Kaleckian growth models.},

This paper considers the implications of easier credit for the influence of higher house prices on consumer expenditure. It argues that with poorly developed credit markets, the effect is likely to be negative, but becomes positive as access to housing collateral increases and down-payments for first time home buyers fall in relation to values. The implications for differences between countries and changes in consumer behaviour over time are explored. Previous studies are reviewed: the omission of credit liberalization and other controls has often biased estimates of housing 'wealth' effects on consumption. New empirical estimates for the UK and US suggest that there was no housing 'wealth effect' before credit market liberalization, but that the housing collateral effect is now significant, larger than the stock market wealth effect, and about twice as large in the US as the UK.},

The profit share is not an exogenous variable, and the correlations between the profit share and economic growth can be positive for some exogenous shocks but negative for others. The terminology, second, suggests a unidirectional causality from distribution to aggregate demand while in fact distribution can itself be directly affected by shifts in aggregate demand. The reduced form correlations, third, depend on interactions with the labor market, and a focus on the goods market can be misleading. If, fourth, empirical estimates are taken at face value, the support for wage-led conclusions is much weaker than suggested by the literature.

	abstract = {We argue that a fundamental difference between the various post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Neo-Kaleckian models, which are more appropriately Robinsonian models, postulate an investment function dependent on profitability, and that is partly autonomous from income. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models, which are in our view compatible with Sraffian models, place the emphasis on the accelerator in the determination of investment. More importantly, since investment is a derived demand, that is, ruled by the adjustment of capacity to autonomous demand, there is a tendency to a normal level of capacity utilization. These are supermultiplier models. In our view the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in an open economy in the long run. We develop an open economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce wage-led growth, showing that the limit to wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The model is unique in emphasizing the role of income distribution in affecting real exchange rates, and it is through this channel that the ambiguous effects of income distribution on growth arise. We also provide some evidence indicating that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization, and we highlight the role of finance in sustaining expansions suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.},

In a simple closed private one-good economy model, each theory is presented drawing on the relationship between the rate of profit and the rate of growth, as well as on the consideration of one major adjusting variable allowing for the convergence of the endogenous variables of the model to their equilibrium values. This allows for a systematic comparison of exogenous and endogenous variables, of the âlogicâ or the chain of causalities in each of the approaches, and of the generation of the long-run equilibrium positions of the system. It is finally shown that the post-Kaleckian model is able to cover many but not all of the results generated by the old neoclassical growth model, new neoclassical growth theories, classicalâMarxian distribution and growth approaches, and post-Keynesian KaldorâRobinson and KaleckiâSteindl distribution and growth theories.},

A more recent tradition argues that an increase in equality and a rise in the wage share can increase growth by increasing consumption and investment demand, so that growth is wage-led. Bhaduri and Marglin and others argue, however, that even if economic activity is demand-determined, a shift in income distribution towards profits can increase output and growth. This paper examines how a reduction in inequality affects economic growth, thereby contributing to the debate on wage-led and profit-led growth and broadening it to focus on inequality rather than the profit share. It does so by reviewing and re-examining the cases in which workers save, the determinants of investment, and the open economy, three issues that have been emphasized in the literature.},

	abstract = {This paper extends a Steindlian model of growth and income distribution to incorporate borrowing by consumers. It shows that borrowing by consumers can improve growth prospects in the short run by increasing consumer demand. However, in the longer run the effects of increasing consumer borrowing are ambiguous because, by increasing consumer debt, it redistributes income towards the rich who have a higher propensity to save, thereby possibly depressing aggregate demand and growth despite the borrowing-induced expansion. The problem may be exacerbated by ï¬nancial considerations involving the increase of the interest rate due to greater borrowing, but these considerations are not necessary for it. The problem is more likely to occur when autonomous investment demand is weak, i.e. when borrowing-induced consumption increases are most required to counter tendencies towards stagnation.},

Despite similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them are 2 extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom and the export-led mercantilist economies. Whereas the former rely mainly on credit-financed household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter rely on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. Using a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types.},

Whereas previous contributions have focussed on taming Harrodian instability, generated by the deviation of the goods market equilibrium rate of capacity utilization from a normal or target rate, we rather focus on the so-far neglected issues of deficit, debt, and distribution dynamics in such models. For this purpose, we treat the growth of government expenditures on goods and services, financed by credit creation, as the exogenous growth rate driving the system. We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues. Finally, we touch upon the economic and, in particular, fiscal policy implications of our model results.},

Financially sophisticated households invest more efficiently but also more aggressively, and overall they incur higher return losses from underdiversification.

After briefly reviewing the content of Pasinetti's volume, the author presents a general consideration on the method employed. The relationship between Pasinetti's approach to the analysis of economic growth and structural change on the one hand, and neoclassical theory, on the other, is then briefly considered. Finally, the model of a âpure labourâ economy is assessed, and the procedure of abstraction to be used in investigating structural dynamics is discussed. In particular, it is argued that Pasinetti's method is based upon a realist approach, and that attention is focused upon general principles rather than empirical regularities derived from observation. In this connection, Smith's and Ricardo's treatments of a âpure labourâ economy are considered, and it is argued that they are based upon alternative simplifying assumptions: exclusion of capital goods in Smith's case, uniform ratios of capital to labour in Ricardo's case. The author maintains that a Ricardian-type pure labour economy may enhance the plausibility of Pasinetti's approach to structural dynamics, and facilitate possible extensions.},

	abstract = {As well-known, the canonical Neo-Kaleckian growth model fails to reconcile actual and normal rates of utilization in equilibrium. Some recent contributions revive an old proposal for solving this problem â making the normal rate of utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate â justifying it with new, micro-founded premises. We argue that these new justifications for the convergence of normal to actual utilization do not stand closer scrutiny. First, the proposed microeconomic model relies on various restrictive assumptions, some of which are mutually inconsistent. Second, the derivation of the macroeconomic adjustment mechanism from the microeconomic analysis involves a logical leap, that can be justified only by a very arbitrary assumption with little economic justification. Finally, we discuss the way in which this mechanism has been incorporated into the Neo-Kaleckian growth model by proposers of this approach.

	abstract = {Within Post-Keynesian macroeconomic theory, the contribution by Marglin and Bhaduri (Marglin and Bhaduri, 1990; Bhaduri and Marglin, 1990) on the relationship between income distribution and growth has progressively asserted itself as a benchmark model, a reference point that has originated and still gives rise to plenty of theoretical and empirical works. Given this popularity, in the related literature it is often claimed that the only open question left is an empirical one - to assess econometrically whether a particular economy is wage or profit-led. In this essay, I will argue that some theoretical issues, related to this model and to the literature inspired by it, can nonetheless be raised. In particular, the treatment of investment appears to be the least convincing aspect of the approach a lÃ  Marglin-Bhaduri. More specifically, it seems possible to raise some doubts about an independent long-run influence of the profit rate or of the profit share on investment, influence that is not in general justified or explained in detail by this literature and that to some extent is simply taken for granted. It will be shown that, if the Marglin-Bhaduri model is integrated with an explicit consideration of the autonomous components of demand, income distribution does not exert any permanent influence on the rate of growth of the economy and on the rate of accumulation. Matching this result with the usual assumption, made in Post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, that capacity utilization is the adjusting variable in equilibrating investment and savings leads to paradoxical results that question the plausibility of an accumulation function like the one used in the Marglin-Bhaduri model.},

We first develop a âKeynesianâ overlapping generations framework assuming that people borrow when they are young and service their debt (interests and principal) in the following periods. Defaults on the principal are also taken into account. We then analyze the theoretical properties of the equilibriums (multiplier effect, stability conditions) resulting from the introduction of this framework in three types of models that differ in regard of who are the debtors and who are the creditors: workers can borrow from capitalists (essay 1) or from their peer (essay 2); capitalists can borrow from their peer (essay 3).},

Firstly, an unemployment benefits system organizes the distribution of the wage bill between employed and unemployed workers, the latter receiving an amount of money corresponding to the subsistence level. Secondly, only individuals with an income above the subsistence level build savings. The combination of these two hypotheses gives rise to an autonomous consumption expenditure whose rate of growth is given by the demographic rate of growth. As a consequence, the rate of capital accumulation spontaneously converges towards the demographic rate of growth (supermultiplier effect), a dynamics that gives a solution to one of the two Harrodian instability problems. The third hypothesis corresponds to the entrepreneursâ attempts to adjust investment in order to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. Whereas such assumption usually generates knife-edge instability, we show here that this instability can be eliminated by the stabilizing properties of the supermultiplier. Moreover, the attempts to adjust investment enable to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. In summary, the model offers a simple, simultaneous solution to the two Harrodian instability problems.},

	abstract = {Unless equality is exogenously imposed between the rate of growth of autonomous demand and the warranted rate, a given rate of growth of autonomous demand generates various 'short-period' warranted rates of growth, period by period. In a stable case, these 'short-period' warranted rates converge to a unique 'long-period' warranted rate, this being determined independently of the rate of growth of autonomous demand. Thus one has a non-steady path of normal output growth. Different rates of growth of autonomous demand engender, for one and the same configuration of normal income distribution, different paths of normal output growth. Moreover, in a circulating-capital-only model with a given constant rate of growth of autonomous demand, different initial rates of growth in aggregate demand also produce different paths of normal output growth. These results point to the importance of effective demand in capital accumulation.},

Whereas previous contributions have focussed on taming Harrodian instability, generated by the deviation of the goods market equilibrium rate of capacity utilization from a normal or target rate, we rather focus on the so-far neglected issues of deficit, debt, and distribution dynamics in such models. For this purpose, we treat the growth of government expenditures on goods and services, financed by credit creation, as the exogenous growth rate driving the system. We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues. Finally, we touch upon the economic and, in particular, fiscal policy implications of our model results.},

The profit share is not an exogenous variable, and the correlations between the profit share and economic growth can be positive for some exogenous shocks but negative for others. The terminology, second, suggests a unidirectional causality from distribution to aggregate demand while in fact distribution can itself be directly affected by shifts in aggregate demand. The reduced form correlations, third, depend on interactions with the labor market, and a focus on the goods market can be misleading. If, fourth, empirical estimates are taken at face value, the support for wage-led conclusions is much weaker than suggested by the literature. A focus on the growth benefits of a reduction in inequality, finally, makes for an impoverished policy discussion.},

We show that the recent debate is directly connected with the old debate about HarrodÂ´s two problems.

	abstract = {We develop a generic Kalecki-Robinson model of growth that, subject to different closures, illustrates the different channels through which the economy can adjust to a change in demand conditions in the long run. The closures are shown to have different implications for the behaviour of the rate of capacity utilization and hence whether and how the economy achieves a âfully-adjusted positionâ (equalization of the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization). Assuming that the normal rate of capacity utilization is exogenously fixed, it is then shown that variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can nevertheless occur â at least within limits â without triggering âHarrodian instabilityâ. This result emanates from a discontinuity in the investment function that is grounded in Harrodâs own macrodynamics, so that it is ultimately the combination of Harrodian and Kaleckian dynamics that gives rise to long-run variations in the actual rate of capacity utilization in the presence of a fixed normal rate. Aggregate and industry-level US capacity utilization data are then used to calculate possible bands within which the rate of capacity utilization may vary without triggering Harrodian instability. A key finding is that the conditions necessary for the latter appear to be relatively rare.},

	abstract = {A recent literature incorporates autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in a medium-run and a longrun Kaleckian growth models. We analyze this literature from the perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model. From this point of view, traditional Kaleckian growth models have three important limitations: they cannot generate a tendency towards normal capacity utilization; they do not imply a positive relationship between the rate of output growth and the investment-output ratio; and they fail to give a growth-determining role to autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in the interpretation of real demand-led growth processes. The medium-run model cannot completely overcome all these three limitations and can generate implausible behavior under certain conditions. The long-run model can overcome all three limitations because it combines an investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle with an endogenous determination of the saving ratio that does not resort to changes in income distribution. Moreover, we argue that an analysis based on the Harrodian instability principle cannot be properly used in the investigation of the stability condition of the Supermultiplier equilibrium of the long-run model. Instead, we suggest that the stability condition of such an equilibrium should be interpreted as a generalized Keynesian stability condition, according to which the propensity to spend should have a value lower than one throughout the whole disequilibrium path of the model.},

First, it provides a simple longârun equilibrium version and dynamic formulation of the model, and compares it to other models of growth and distribution using a common framework and focusing on the effect of a change in income distribution on growth. Second, it shows that the model can be modified to examine other components of autonomous demand growth, including government spending, exports, consumption by workers, and investment and technical change, and to simultaneous multiple sources of autonomous demand growth. Finally, it comments on some methodological issues concerning the model, and on its implications for the notion of longrun equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The neo-Kaleckian theoretical framework focuses on the importance of effective demand in the income generation process in order to relate its functional distribution â share of income that goes to wage and proï¬ts â to economic growth, and thus characterize the demand regime that leads it, either wage-led (wage share positively affecting growth) or proï¬t led (proï¬t share positively affecting growth). Recent contributions include extensions to the standard model such as open economy effects, family credit, and personal distribution of income to further characterize the regime type. Based on that approach, this paper aims to empirically analyze the performance of the Brazilian economy between 1995 and 2015 in order to identify the relationship between functional distribution of income and aggregate demand. The idea is to test whether variables that are not present in the seminal model that seem to affect the brazillian economy in the 2000s â such as consumer credit, personal distribution of income, commodity prices and the share of service sector on GDP â alter the relationship between the two variables. Our results suggest that the control for those aspects indeed change the intercept and inclination of our demmand and distributive curves.},

The paper then explores the implications of incorporating the super-multiplier in the neo-Kaleckian and Cambridge growth models. Lastly, it shows how labor markets and unemployment can be added into super-multiplier models to provide a comprehensive growth model that addresses Solow's (1956, Journal of Economics, 70, 65â94) labor market knife-edge problem. Incorporating labor markets does not change the fundamental super-multiplier result that growth is determined by the growth of autonomous demand.},

We show that the Federal Reserve data on capacity utilization, which have been used by both sides of this debate, are the wrong kind of data for the issue under examination. Instead, a more appropriate measurement can be derived from the data on the Average Workweek of Capital. We argue that the long-run dynamic adjustment proposed by Kaleckian scholars lacks a coherent economic rationale, and provide an alternative path toward the endogeneity of the desired utilization at the micro and macro levels. Finally, we examine the proposed adjustment mechanism econometrically. Our results verify the endogeneity of the normal utilization rate.},

Some recent papers have discussed the role of noncapacity generating semi-autonomous expenditures in growth theory. This literature ties together several aspects of heterodox thought: growth and distribution; the Sraffian supermultiplier; Duesenberryâs relative income hypothesis; the endogenous money approach and KaleckiâLuxemburg external markets. The basic message is that non-wage sources of effective demand, based on mortgage and consumer credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving long-run output growth. This article gives a broad overview of the role of financed-induced semiautonomous expenditures in growth, cycles and crises, and thus criticizes some of the previous approaches that claim to mimic actual cycles while abstracting from these crucial determinants of economic activity.},

The aim of this paper is to propose a model for the housing sector in the context of a macroeconomic model for the whole economy, with all major relationships between real and financial markets properly accounted for, and a strong tie with national accounts. The general model is developed in the tradition of dynamic stock-flow consistent models (see for example Godley and Lavoie, 2007). We begin by presenting a general setting for a dynamic model, consistent with the Social Accounting Matrix aprroach to national accounts. We analyze some key variables related to the evolution of the U.S. housing market. Finally, after presenting the key features of the model, we simulate it to analyze its properties and its ability to reproduce some key stylized facts on the recent evolution of the U.S. economy.},

The reasons for this fall have recently been the subject of a growing amount of literature that has tried to pin down the effects of technology, globalization, and changes in labour market institutions (see, inter alia, IMF, 2007; OECD, 2007; EC, 2007; ILO/IILS, 2011; Rodrik, 1997; Diwan, 2001; Harrison, 2002; Onaran, 2009; Rodriguez and Jayadev, 2010; Stockhammer, 2011). This chapter offers a theoretical and empirical assessment of the effects of this pro-capital redistribution of income on growth at both national and global levels.},

The two hypotheses are (a) that investment oscillates over time and (b) that the community's marginal propensity to consume is lower when income contracts in slumps than when it increases in booms.

	abstract = {What determines the rate of growth, the distribution of income, and the structure of relative prices under capitalism? What, in short, makes capitalist economies tick? This watershed treatise analyzes the answers to these questions provided by three major theoretical traditions: neoclassical, neo-Marxian, and neo-Keynesian. Until now, the mutual criticism exchanged by partisans of the different traditions has focused disproportionately on the logical shortcomings of rival theories, or on such questions as whether or not input-output relationships can be described by a continuous-substitution production function. In this book, these are at best secondary issues. The real distinguishing features of the theories, for Stephen Marglin, are their characterization of labor markets and capital accumulation. For clarity, Marglin first sets out the essential features of each theory in the context of a common production model with a single good and a fixed-coefficient technology. He then formalizes the different theories as alternative ways of closing the model. In subsequent chapters he examines the effects of relaxing key simplifying assumptions, in particular the characterization of technology and the homogeneity of output and capital. And although his primary emphasis is theoretical, he does not ignore the problem of empirically testing the theories. Finally, he synthesizes the insights of the neo-Marxian and neo-Keynesian models into a single model that transcends the shortcomings of each taken separately. Marglin anticipates that partisans of the different traditions will agree on one point: each will allow that the book reveals the shortcomings of the other theories but will insist that it fails utterly to reflect the power and majesty of one's own particular brand of truth. Growth, Distribution, and Prices will be controversial, but it will not be ignored.},

Short-, medium- and long-run equilibria are considered. In the long-run case, the expectations of sales growth governing investment change adaptively, and this, combined with the autonomous growth rate of exports, produces convergence of the actual rate of capacity utilization to its normal rate. It is demonstrated that some aspects of the main Kaleckian results can be preserved not only in the short or medium run but also in the long run, in the sense that both (1) a decrease in the propensity to save, and (2) a change in income distribution favoring labor, bring about higher average rates of production growth and capital accumulation. However, the impact of a change in the profit share is shown to be subjected to the condition that the responsiveness of the real exchange rate with respect to the profit share has to be bounded from above, confirming that the scope for wage-led demand or wage-led growth can be limited by open-economy considerations, even within the supermultiplier context.},

The rejection of this proposition is mainly based on the endogeneity of the rate of capacity utilization, both in the short and the long run. This endogeneity often relies on a discrepancy between the realized and the normal rates of profit, or between the realized and the target rate of capacity utilization, a discrepancy which some authors believe is unwarranted in long run analysis. Various models that eliminate this divergence are outlined. In all these models, the normal rate of profit itself is taken as an endogenous variable. In the first two models, the normal rate of profit depends either on the realized profit rate or the rate of interest. Supply-led results may then reappear in long run analysis. In the last model, one introduces the possibility of a divergence between the rate of return as assessed and targeted by firms, and the rate of return that is actually incorporated into prices. This divergence arises because of the bargaining power of workers and their real wage resistance. Under these conditions, the demand-led results of the Kaleckian tradition are recovered in a model with definite solutions.},

	abstract = {What principles should govern the design of governmental. budgetary and financial policy? Policymakers in the major industrial countries and officials of international organizations are deeply concerned about rising public debt burdens. But there are others who believe that only public spending on goods and services matters, while public debt and deficits are irrelevant. Principles of Budgetary and Financial Policy seeks to bridge the gap between these views, showing how rigorous economic theory can be applied to the study of fiscal, financial, and monetary policy and examining the contributions of such policy to the goals of cyclical stabilization, structural adjustment, and secular growth in modern "mixed" economies. This book brings together twelve years of Willem Buiter's work on fiscal and financial policy, including both previously published and new essays. In addition to raising the level of policy debate, it unites the two subdisciplines into which economists have split the study of fiscal and financial policy: the microeconomic theory of neoclassical public finance and the macroeconomic neoKeynesian theory of stabilization policy. The book's introductory section sets the scene through broad ranging, nontechnical papers emphasizing the unavoidable interconnection of the stabilization role of fiscal policy with its allocational and distributional roles. In the following sections Buiter focuses on the measurement of public sector activity over time, considering how (and to what extent) a longer-run perspective on the government's finances can be summarized in a single comprehensive government balance sheet. He examines "crowding out," the displacement of private economic activity by public economic activity, explaining why and how public debt and deficits matter and emphasizing the distinction between various financing issues. The fiscal origins of inflation are addressed, as well as the eventual monetization of public sector deficits. In an extensive concluding essay Buiter considers the role of fiscal policy in stabilization and structural adjustment in open developing countries.},

We provide an exposition of the underlying theory of wage- and profit-led growth. We emphasize the implications of possible non-linearities in the determination of the final equilibrium and whyâbecause of themâa redefinition of the concept of wage- and profit-led economy is necessary. We estimate the demand and distribution schedule for the US economy using a two-stage least squares approach. Our findings confirm the hypothesis of a non-linear distribution schedule and therefore the need to redefine the concepts wage- and profit-led growth.},

Instead, a more appropriate measurement can be derived from the data on the Average Workweek of Capital. We argue that the long-run dynamic adjustment proposed by Kaleckian scholars lacks a coherent economic rationale, and provide an alternative path toward the endogeneity of the desired utilization at the micro and macro levels. Finally, we examine the proposed adjustment mechanism econometrically. Our results verify the endogeneity of the normal utilization rate.},

These models have been put to so much use that it made us wonder if this trend was based on their ability to generate macroeconomic equilibrium variables located within a reasonable range of some conceivable economic reality. While the Kaleckians spend much time debating how much their models are wage-led vs. profit-led, our work lies upstream of these questions, for we are investigating the Kaleckian modelsâ existence properties. We conducted a series of simulations based on a basic, three-equation model: an investment function, a savings function and an equation for the firmsâ objectives. By estimating the parameters composing these different functions without recourse to econometrics but by means of an economic diagnostic, and by specifying an assumed range of value for the equilibrium variable, we tested these modelsâ ability to produce plausible results. We also tested the modelsâ stability property. Although stability is often put forth as a prerequisite in the study of such models, in the Kaleckian literature the question of how plausible is the stability is rarely raised.},

Using ï¬rm-level and macroeconomic data to comply with the variety of FIHâs interpretations, we empirically assess the relations between leverage and ï¬nancial fragility âconceptualised according to Minskyâs scale (from the ï¬nancially sound to the more fragile ï¬rms: hedge, speculative and Ponzi) â in the United States economy (1970-2014). The main ï¬ndings are: 1. the evolution of the aggregate leverage ratio does not account for the systemic ï¬nancial fragility, measured by the frequency of speculative and Ponzi ï¬rms; 2. within the biggest ï¬rms, the leverage has increased along with the incidence of hedge ï¬nancing, and for the smallest ï¬rms group the opposite has happened. We conclude that the positive relation among leverage and ï¬nancial fragility cannot be deemed to be a general outcome.},

A peculiar feature of these autonomous expenditures is that in contrast to investment they are non-capacity creating. The model combines the Sraffian multiplier, a conflicting-claims theory of inflation, a Harrodian instability mechanism and effects tied to the size of the reserve army of labor. The long-run version of the model converges conditionally to stable rates of employment and inflation, at the normal rate of capacity utilization. The model vindicates some of the main Keynesian or Kaleckian tenets, in the sense that an increase in the marginal propensity to save out of profits or in the bargaining power of firms generate lower average rates of capital accumulation and capacity utilization during the traverse.},

The model consists of various household groups that receive income from different sources or from the same sources in different proportions. The dynamic linkage between functional and personal income distribution is formulated as part of a complete macroeconomic system. Inequality decomposition techniques are employed to associate income sources with personal income distribution. Simulation exercises are conducted to reveal the various ways through which functional and personal income distribution interact. In the simulations, a rise in the exogenous component of low-skilled workersâ wage share reduces inequality in the short run; in the medium to long run inequality starts increasing due to certain macroeconomic developments, but remains lower than its initial level in almost all cases. A change in functional income distribution due to a rise in the dividend payout ratio of firms increases inequality both in the short run and the long run.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a simple theoretical framework to assess the macroeconomic implications of debt-fuelled consumption. In particular, the analysis is conducted through an extended super-multiplier model with endogenous credit money, which highlights the role of the autonomous components of demand, and in particular autonomous consumption, as the main drivers of economic growth. The author sketches a comparison with alternative heterodox formulations. He argues that, unlike the neo-Kaleckian models, in the model proposed here output growth adjusts to the path of debt-financed consumption. Having treated investment as fully induced, it follows that also the rate of capital accumulation adjusts to the rate of growth, which is itself determined by the evolution of autonomous demand. Finally, it is shown that the stability of the ratio of debt to debtorsâ income is affected, among other things, by the growth differential between workersâ autonomous consumption (and debt) and the other autonomous components of demand, i.e. public expenditure and capitalistsâ autonomous consumption.},

Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a âfacilitating marketâ for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

	abstract = {Kaleckians describe a normal rate of capacity utilization that is subject to hysteresis eï¬ects. This means that the normal rate varies directly with the actual rate of capacity utilization, ensuring that steady-state equilibrium conditions in the Kaleckian model are fully adjusted (the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization are equalized) but without this last condition implying that the rate of capacity utilization is constant in the long run. The relationship between distribution and growth unique to the Kaleckian model is thus preserved. The hysteresis mechanism has been criticized from various quarters, however, these criticisms focusing on its alleged lack of behavioural foundations. This paper shows that consistent with the stylized facts, variation in the normal rate of capacity utilization in response to variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can be derived from the links between both variables and the volatility of the macroeconomic environment â volatility, in the presence of fundamental uncertainty, being an important reason why ï¬rms deliberately under-utilize capacity (even in the long run) in the ï¬rst place. The result is an empirically-grounded behavioural foundation for hysteresis in the normal rate of capacity utilization.},

In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be âamplifiedâ via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985â2013.},

	abstract = {In the vast majority of OECD economies, house prices in real terms have been moving up strongly since the mid-1990s. Because of the important role housing wealth has been playing during the current upswing, this paper will look more closely at what is underlying these developments for 18 OECD countries over the period from 1970 to the present, with a view to shedding some light on whether or not prices are in line with fundamentals. The paper begins by putting the most recent housing price run-ups in the context of the experiences of the past 35 years. It then examines current valuations against a range of benchmarks. It concludes with a review of the links between a possible correction of housing prices and real activity. The main highlights from this analysis are as follows: 1) The size and duration of the current real house price increases; the degree to which they have tended to move together across countries; and the extent to which they have disconnected from the business cycle are unprecedented. 2) Overvaluation of real house prices may only apply to a relatively small number of countries. However, the extent to which these prices look to be fairly valued depends largely on longer-term interest rates remaining at or close to their current low levels. 3) If house prices were to adjust downward, the historical record suggests that the drops might be large and that the process could be protracted, given the observed stickiness of nominal house prices and the current low rates of inflation.},

The key features of the model include the interactive effects of endogenous technical progress, the non-capacity-creating demand component that grows at an exogenous rate and, in its long-run version, a Harrodian adjustment mechanism. It turns out that, whereas the model converges towards the normal rate of capacity utilization, the main tenets of the Keynesian model are still valid in the long run as well as in the short run in the sense that all of the average rates of accumulation, capacity utilization, and technical progress are lower during the traverse after the propensity to save or the share of profits goes up. The conditions under which the productivity regime can be wage-led are examined, and the possible effects of an exogenous technical shift are also discussed.},

This paper gives a partial update on advances in Kalecki-Minsky modelling. First, theoretically, it discusses the notion of pseudo-Goodwin cycles. Second, it presents empirical findings on endogenous debt cycles. Third, it reviews evidence of the relative size of distributional and financial effects on demand.

We distinguish between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and use activity and vulnerability measures. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for 1997-2007. We find different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, suggesting the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence that financialisation is linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation. There is limited evidence that market-based financial systems are more financialised. Foreign financial inflows do not seem a main driver. We do not find indication that an investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Our findings suggest financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors and countries.},

By means of an agent-based model, we replicate an artiï¬cial creditnetwork economy in order to assess the impact of growing income inequality in the presence of peer effects and home equity borrowing. We show that the resulting debt-ï¬nanced consumption boom jeopardises the stability of the economic system, thus paving the way for a ï¬nancial crisis. Our model includes a behavioural rule for consumption based on expenditure cascades, a hierarchical structure of household ï¬nance, an articulated credit market with collateralised consumption loans and mortgages and a simple housing market. Results show that the model is able to capture the economic and social pressure of inequality on low and middle income households that pushes them to increase their consumption via home equity extraction. Rising non-performing loans lead to higher bad debt on the banksâ balance sheets and, consequently, to the emergence of a crisis as an endogenous dynamic.},

The model is characterized by four types of agents: households, firms, banks and a central bank, which interact through different types of markets: a consumption goods market, a labor market, a housing market and a credit market. We model a wealth effect of housing wealth into households consumption budget as the main link between the housing market and the real economy. Banks will extend mortgages to households only if the expenditure on housing, as a proportion of total income, is lower than a given threshold (Î²). Different simulations are preformed to see how changing Î²effects the housing market and the real economy. We find that by lowering the constraint on bank lending, i.e. increasing Î², housing prices boom, positively affecting the real economy},

	abstract = {In the postwar era, developed economies have experienced two substantial trends in the net capital share of aggregate income: a rise during the last several decades, which is well known, and a fall of comparable magnitude that continued until the 1970s, which is less well known. Overall, the net capital share has increased since 1948, but once disaggregated this increase turns out to come entirely from the housing sector: the contribution to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other. Several influential accounts of the recent rise emphasize the role of increased capital accumulation, but this view is at odds with theory and evidence: it requires empirically improbable elasticities of substitution, and it presumes a correlation between the capital-income ratio and capital share that is not visible in the data. A more limited narrative that stresses scarcity and the increased cost of housing better fits the data. These results are clarified using a new, multisector model of factor shares.},

Home equity-based borrowing was stronger for younger households and households with low credit scores. The evidence suggests that borrowed funds were used for real outlays.

	abstract = {We develop a neo-Kaleckian growth model that emphasizes the importance of consumption behavior. In our model, workers first make consumption decisions based on their gross income, and then treat debt servicing commitments as a substitute for saving. Workersâ borrowing is induced by their desire to keep up with the consumption standard set by rentiersâ consumption, reflecting an aspect of the relative income hypothesis. As a result of this consumption and debt servicing behavior, consumer debt accumulation and income distribution have effects on aggregate demand, profitability, and economic growth that differ from those found in existing models. We also investigate the financial sustainability of the Golden Age and Neoliberal growth regimes within our framework. It is shown that distributional changes between the Golden Age and the Neoliberal regimes, together with corresponding changes in consumption emulation behavior via expenditure cascades, suffice to make the Neoliberal growth regime unsustainable.},

	abstract = {The paper argues that Harrodian instability is an instance of what Hicks in his book Capital and Growth (1965) called static instability, related to the direction (and not to the intensity) of the disequilibrium adjustment process. We show why such instability obtains in demand-led growth models in which the ratio of capacity creating private investment to output ratio is given exogenously by the aggregate marginal propensity to save. We also show that Sraffian Supermultiplier model overcomes the Harrodian instability and that its demand-led equilibrium is statically stable. It is explained that the latter results do not follow from the presence of autonomous non-capacity creating expenditure component as such but from its presence within a model in which investment is driven by the capital stock adjustment principle (i.e., the flexible accelerator). Finally, we argue that, although being statically stable, the equilibrium growth path of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model can be dynamically stable or unstable depending on the intensity of the reaction of investment to demand. We then provide a discrete time sufficient condition for the dynamic stability of such equilibrium that implies that the marginal propensity to invest remains lower than the marginal propensity to save during the adjustment process, a modified Keynesian stability condition.},

	abstract = {Keynesian models of household behavior suggest that a shift in the distribution of income toward proï¬tsâor toward rentiersâshould imply an increase in the propensity to save out of income for the population as a whole. However, the available empirical evidence for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily. Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent of the population increased steadily, with wide ï¬uctuations related to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market. The aim of this paper is to lay down a growth model, grounded in the Post Keynesian stock-ï¬ow-consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie, to analyze the links between consumption and saving behavior of two classes of householdsâï¬nancial markets and the housing market. The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path.},

	abstract = {Thirlwall's law, given by the ratio of the rate of growth of exports to the income elasticity of imports is a key result of balance-of-payments-constrained long-run growth models with balanced trade. Some authors have extended the analysis to incorporate long-run net capital flows. We provide a critical evaluation of these efforts and propose an alternative approach to deal with long-run external debt sustainability, based on two key features. First, we treat the external debt-to-exports ratio as the relevant indicator for the analysis of external debt sustainability. Second, we include an external credit constraint in the form of a maximum acceptable level of this ratio. The main results that emerge are that sustainable long-run capital flows can positively affect the long-run level of output, but not the rate of growth compatible with the balance-of-payments constraint, as exports must ultimately tend to grow at the same rate as imports. Therefore, Thirlwall's law still holds.},
