Model CarvalhoDiGuilmi Supermultiplier version (ver. 0.1)

This paper introduces heterogeneous microeconomic behavior into a demand-driven
stock-flow consistent model with endogenous credit creation, so as to study the joint
dynamics of both the personal and the functional distribution of income, household debt
and aggregate demand. The distinctive feature is in that the aggregation of
heterogeneous agents is not performed numerically as in traditional agent-based
models, but by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in
statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. Numerical and
analytical results reveal that while boosting aggregate demand, a raise in the minimum
wage and a reduction in wage inequality can also lead the economy toward more
sustainable paths in both household debt and the degree of â€™financialisation'. These
results are shown to be the exact opposite to the observed responses of the economy to
a raise in the interest rate charged on bank loans.
