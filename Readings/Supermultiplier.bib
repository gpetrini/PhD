            We model of demand-led growth with endogenous adjustment of labour supply and productivity, an approach that reconciles Harrod’s warranted rate of demand growth with supply. The model delivers a range of growth paths and unemployment rates rather than a single ‘natural rate’. Theoretically, the steady-state growth path may be dynamically stable or unstable, but empirical calibration favours stability. We show analytically that if demand dynamics are stable, supply will converge to the demand-determined growth path. While a minimum unemployment rate ultimately imposes a supply constraint on growth, empirical results show that a wide range of growth rates are feasible across different demand regimes. The results explain how economies can become trapped with low growth due to weak demand or fiscal austerity and suggest policy responses to stagnant demand.},

	abstract = {Credit explosion, debt overhang and asset bubbles, of the size observed in the period 1995-2008, have been a recurrent problem of advanced capitalism. In this paper we analyse the causes and consequences of over-indebtedness from a supermultiplier model that takes into account the debt-service. We contend that the accelerator of investment is a stable and stabilizing mechanism when investment depends on the expected increases in “permanent” demand. The problems of instability are rooted in the consumptionmultiplier when it does not depend on fixed parameters (like the tax rate) but on coefficients that evolve endogenously; namely the debt-burden and the debt service. To control the financial sources of this instability, monetary authorities should prevent that credit rises systematically above the growth of nominal GDP.},
