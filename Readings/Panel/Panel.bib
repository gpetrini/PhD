	abstract = {This paper studies the impact of changes in immovable property tax revenues on the growth rate of house prices by analysing a panel of 34 OECD countries over the period 1970–2014. Starting from the annual series of immovable property tax revenues, we isolate years of significant shifts in the property tax regime and study their impact on house prices. We find a strong negative relationship between increases in immovable property tax revenues and house prices. This relationship is robust to the inclusion of cyclical determinants of house prices, country and year fixed effects, and country-specific linear trends. We also propose an instrumental variable strategy based on countries’ legal origins that confirms a statistically significant negative impact of such taxes in the short run.},

We adopt the methodology of Girardi and Pariboni (2016) and extend it to a panel framework. We apply panel unit root, cointegration, and causality tests that are robust to endogenous regressors, cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across countries. Our results are supportive of the Sraffian supermultiplier model. In a heterogeneous panel framework, autonomous demand and output follow a long-run equilibrium relationship and there exists panel long-run causality that goes unidirectionally from autonomous demand to output. We also empirically verify the investment accelerator (the mechanism that enables the dynamic stability of the model) by confirming the existence of same-sign panel causality running unidirectionally from the growth rate of autonomous demand to the investment share. Our results call for national economic policies aimed at promoting the components of autonomous demand that act as locomotives of growth in each country.},

We use a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the performance of several different methods designed to reduce the bias of the estimated coefficients for the longer, narrower panels commonly found for macro data. We find that the bias of the least squares dummy variable approach can be significant, even when the time dimension of the panel is as large as 30. For panels with small time dimensions, we find a corrected least squares dummy variable estimator to be the best choice. However, as the time dimension of the panel increases, the computationally simpler Anderson-Hsiao estimator performs equally well. We apply our recommendations to a panel of countries to show that increases in income growth precede increases in savings rates and increases in savings rates precede declines in income growth.},

We adopt a weak instrument asymptotic approximation to study the behavior of various estimators near the unit circle. We show that an estimator based on long differencing the model is much less biased than conventional implementations of the GMM estimator for the dynamic panel model. We also show that under the weak instrument approximation conventional GMM estimators are dominated in terms of mean squared error by an estimator with far less moment conditions. The long difference (LD) estimator mimics the infeasible optimal procedure through its reliance on a small set of moment conditions.},

It is shown that the centering of the LM statistic is correct for fixed T and N. Importantly, the proposed bias-adjusted LM test is consistent even when the Pesaran's (2004) CD test is inconsistent. Also an alternative bias-adjusted LM test, which is consistent under local error cross-section dependence of any fixed order p, is proposed. The finite sample behavior of the proposed tests is investigated and compared to that of the LM and CD tests. It is shown that the bias-adjusted LM tests successfully control the size, maintaining satisfactory power in panel with exogenous regressors and normal errors. However, it is also shown that the bias-adjusted LM test is not as robust as the CD test to non-normal errors and/or in the presence of weakly exogenous regressors.},

The proposed test, denoted by Δ˜, exploits the cross section dispersion of individual slopes weighted by their relative precision. In the case of models with strictly exogenous regressors, but with non-normally distributed errors, the test is shown to have a standard normal distribution as (N,T) →j∞ such that N/T2→0. When the errors are normally distributed, a mean-variance bias adjusted version of the test is shown to be normally distributed irrespective of the relative expansion rates of N and T. The test is also applied to stationary dynamic models, and shown to be valid asymptotically so long as N/T→κ, as (N,T)→j∞, where 0⩽κ{\textless}∞. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the test has the correct size and satisfactory power in panels with strictly exogenous regressors for various combinations of N and T. Similar results are also obtained for dynamic panels, but only if the autoregressive coefficient is not too close to unity and so long as T⩾N.},

The proposed tests are based on average of pair-wise correlation coefficients of the OLS residuals from the individual regressions in the panel, and can be used to test for cross section dependence of any fixed order p, as well as the case where no a priori ordering of the cross section units is assumed, referred to a CD(p) and CD tests, respectively. Asymptotic distribution of these tests are derived and their power function analysed under different alternatives. It is shown that these test are correctly centred for fixed N and T, and are robust to single or multiple breaks in the slope coefficients and/or error variances. The small sample properties of the tests have the correct size in very small samples and satisfactory power, and as predicted by the theory, quite robust to the presence of unit roots and structural breaks. The use of the CD test is illustrated by applying it to study the degree of dependence in per capital output innovations across countries within a given region and across countries in different regions. The results show significant evidence of cross dependence in output innovations across many countries and regions of the world.},

The degree of persistence in individual regression error, the intercept and trend coefficient are allowed to vary freely across individuals. As both the cross-section and time series dimensions of the panel grow large, the pooled t-statistic has a limiting normal distribution that depends on the regression specification but is free from nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the asymptotic results provide a good approximation to the test statistics in panels of moderate size, and that the power of the panel-based unit root test is dramatically higher, compared to performing a separate unit root test for each individual time series.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes unit root tests for dynamic heterogeneous panels based on the mean of individual unit root statistics. In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey–Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) →∞, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) →∞. A diagonal convergence result with T and N→∞ while N/T→k,k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey–Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N→∞ for a fixed T, so long as T{\textgreater}5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T{\textgreater}6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993).},

We show that while infrastructure does tend to cause long-run economic growth, there is substantial variation across countries.

We present an alternative transformation for models with predetermined instruments which preserves the orthogonality among the errors. Finally, we consider models with predetermined variables that have constant correlation with the effects and illustrate their importance with simulations.},
