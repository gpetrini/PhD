    Countries

**Citation:**

**5SS:** @sanchez_price_2011 estimates a Stock-Flow model to evaluate
house supply responsiveness. Evidence suggest that less responsive house
supply leads to an increase in housing prices due to demand shock.
However, more responsiveness is also related to a bigger cyclical
swings. The authors still argues that a more responsive house supply is
more desirable. The estimation also reports a country-specific
responsiveness and the relevance of other macro policies.
