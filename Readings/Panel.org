| *Background*                                  | Credit aggregates and asset prices play no role in standard models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | The must be multidirectional links between house prices and monetary variables. According to lifecycle mode, an increase in house prices leads to an increase in consumption. When house prices increases, residential investment Tobin's $q$ increase as well. So, residential investment is a positive function of house prices. House prices assumed to be sticker than monetary variables. Financial, structural e institutional changes in the 80s are supposed to  change the macroeconomic dynamics. |
| *Purpose*                                     | To investigate whether money, credit, house prices and GDP have multidirectional links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Links credit and asset prices in both directions and connects house prices with monetary variables (/i.e./ money, credit, house prices and economy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Relevance*                                   | This paper provides a TsPanel data for a similar country and time selection in the dissertation. Furthermore, indicates some technical literature for TsPanel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Fixed-effects panel VAR. 17 industrialized countries (1970-(1985-)2006). Housing booms are included with dummy variables. *Estimation:* OLS without time dummies. This specification is employed because $T>N$, so dummies would involve loss in efficiency. For Cholesky decomposition, ordering was based on monetary transmission literature.                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Results*                                     | *Stronger Multidirectional* link between house prices and monetary variables in the recent subsample (1985-2006). Stronger monetary shocks in housing boom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Monetary variables affects future house prices and the other way around also occurs. Only money growth affects future CPI. CPI shock capture supply-side disturbances ($\Uparrow cpi,\, \Downarrow y, \Uparrow ir, \Downarrow hp, \Downarrow m, \Downarrow c$) An house price shock increase all other variables. The same holds for money and credit shock. Money  and credit growth provides information about emerging house price booms or bubbles.                                                     |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | The authors themselves indicates that results are not statiscally significants. Housing boom included with dummy variables. Residential investment variable not included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | House owners gain from a house price  increse while renters lose. The authors indicates that estimating individual VARs would lead to few degrees of freedom. Lag order: 4 (AIC).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *5SS*                                         | The authors estimate a time-series fixed effects panel data for 17 industrialized countries for 1970-2006. They report a multidirectional relation between money, credit, house prices and GDP growth. This effects are stronger during housing booms.                                                                 However, they do not include residential investment.                                                                                                                                  |


**** Main model
 
$$
Y_{i,t} = A_i + A(L)Y_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

- $Y$ endogenous variables
  - Variables: real GDP ($y$), consumer price index ($cpi$), short-term nominal interest rate ($ir$), nominal house prices ($hp$), nominal broad money ($m$) and nominal bank credit ($c$)
- $A$ country-specific fixed effects
  - Countries:  US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Australia

**** Housing boom estimation

$$
Y_{i,t} = A_i + A_{NB}(L)Y_{i,t}\cdot D^{NB}_{i,t} + A_{B}(L)Y_{i,t}\cdot D^{B}_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

in which $B$ and $NB$ stands for boom and not housing boom respectively. Housing boom defined as follows (p. 24):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
persistent deviation of real house prices from a smooth trend, calculated based on a one-sided HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 100,000. A boom is defined as a positive deviation of house prices from this smooth trend of more than 5% lasting at least 12 quarters. 
#+END_QUOTE


Next, another model is estimated whith $D^{NB}$ equals to one for those countries with lower real house price increases and zero otherwise and the same procedure was repeated for $D^B$. The same results were found: monetary variables have stronger effects during housing boom despite not being statistically significant.

Then, the author moves towards country-specific factors based on available LTV (loan-to-Value) ratio. They find countries with higher LTV to be the ones with higher price increases (relatively). However, the is no perfect correlation between this variables.

**** Other stuff

Quoting in defense of TsPanel (p. 15) based on Gavin and Theodorou
(2005):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
adopting a panel approach in a macro framework like our own
helps to uncover common dynamic relationships which might otherwise be obscured by idiosyncratic effects at the individual country level

| *Background*                                  | Boom and burst in credit markets (industrialized countries). Credit usually plays no significant role on conventional models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Some authors have proposed to analyze credit differently from bonds and a other debt instruments (/i.e./ relaxing perfect substitutability of loans) and rise a different role of credit. *Financial accelerator model:* Both firms and households are borrowing constrained and can only borrow if they offer *collateral*. Borrowing capacity is supposed to be *procyclical* since Net Worth is procyclical as well. *Lifecycle model* supports the mechanism from property prices increase and expenditure increase. However, this effect is not true for renters. So, the general effect is mixed. The author also argues that property prices affect bank capital value directly (own assets) and indirectly (value of loans secured by property). |

| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Banking credit as a function of economic activity, interest rates and property prices for 16 industrialized countries (1980 onwards). *Estimation procedure:* VEC for each country. Interest rates are supposed to have a negative effect on credit demand (financing cost). Data are taken from BIS database. Aggregate property price is defined as average of residential and commercial property prices and are deflated by consumer price index. Countrywide residential prices are available for some countries only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Results*                                     | Finds a positive long-run relationships between  real credit, real GDP and real property prices and negative to real interest rate. Property prices are important determinant of long-run borrowing capacity to the private sector. Increases in property prices implies a positive effect on bank lending in most countries (IRF).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**** Long-run Relationships
  
$$
C = \alpha + \beta_1 Y + \beta_2 R + \beta_3 P + \varepsilon
$$

- $C$ real credit to the private sector
- $Y$ real GDP
- $R$ short-tem real interest rate (financing costs)
- $P$ real property prices

First, the author estimate the model without property prices and do not find a cointegration relationship between variables. Next, include property prices and then report a long-run relationship.

More recently, there is a macroeconomic turn to consumption-related variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Mortgage provision is one of the principal drivers of growth in the financial sector. House price increases is related to household endebtedness in advanced economies. Household indebtedness has a positive short-term effect on growth but a negative one on the long-run                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Purpose*                                     | The authors argue that CPE does not consider the financial sector sufficiently, mainly regarding household indebtednes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Connect house prices with household indebtedness and the latter with economic growth. Additionally, evaluate whether household indebtedness and house prices affects each other in *both* directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Relevance*                                   | Analyze almost all the countries intended for the dissertation in a similar time range. So, it is an important paper for comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Three sets of equations: debt (households and business) on GDP growth; households debt as a function of house prices and GDP and; house prices as a function o household indebtedness and GDP. Specification tested: ARDL with robust panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE); mean group (MG) estimator to evaluate the *consistency* of the parameter (more robust in case of country heterogeneity) and two ADL model to examine the VoC subcategories using median value for each country of the stock market value traded to GDP ratio divided by the bank credit to GDP                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Time range*                                  | 1980 to 2017. The starting point was chosen to be related with the re-rise of financial sector  (see Bengtsson and Rynes 2015).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Countries*                                   | 18 advanced countries in an  unbalanced pooled panel data:  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. *Market-based banking economies:*  Switzerland, USA, Canada, Spain, Netherlands, Japan, UK, Sweden and Australia. *Less MB:* Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and New Zealand. *LMEs:* Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. *CMEs:* Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. *MMEs:* France, Italy and Spain. Countries without hight house inflation:  Germany, Italy and Japan. |
| *Results*                                     | Household debt has _stronger_ and more statistically significant effects on GDP than business debt. Changes in household debt volumes are largely a result of _house price fluctuations_. Macroeconomic effects of household debt and house prices are present across the cases in the sample and are _not limited to the Anglosphere countries_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | The author proposes an classification criteria for more or less marked-based economy based on Beck et al. (2009).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | Do not include residential investiment variable nor its specification. Since residential investment is not included, there is no reason for house prices affects GDP growth rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| *Background*                                  | Heterogenous recovery after the great financial crisis. Residential investment plays a prominent role on the recovery. This justify the relevance of this paper.  Most research on Housing has been analyzing house prices and not its volume. Household behavior change: house as a durable good $\Rightarrow$ asset                                                                                                                                  |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Residential investiment usually leads the economic recovery. Both house prices and construction section still at pre-GFC levels. In the short-run, housing is constrained by its supply. As a consequence, increasing demand press housing prices while it supply becomes gradually more elastic. Quantitative equilibrium adjustments. Housing is considered a speculative asset. ARDL method assumes that all variables are endogenously determined. |
| *Purpose*                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Increasing housing prices ($RHP$) accelerates real residential investment ($RRI$) as long as household expect that this rise will last in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Relevance*                                   | This paper move towards the residential investment literature paying attention to the market-finance link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | ARDL model for 17 OECD countries from 1970-2013. *Variables:* Real Disposable Income, real house prices, real interest rate (housing loans), unemployment rate and volume of banking credit. *Demographic and Monetary Channels:* Mortgage rate and credit.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Results*                                     | For the US, banking credit and Real House Prices are the most statistically significant variables. Only Canada, Japan, New Zeland, Norway, UK and USA do not have statistically significant Real Disposable Income variable. So, for most of analyzed countries, RDY is the most relevant determinant of RRI. Positive correlation between house prices and housing acquisition.                                                                       |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Interest rate is not the most powerful variable to influence residential investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | There probably is endogenety problems between variables (/e.g./ UN and RDY; RHP and C; RDY and MR, and, most important, RDY and RRI and so on). *Todo:* Check if authors tested controls (Problably do not).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | There is still no consensus about residential investment specification function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| *5SS*                                         | This paper contributes to residential investment empirical agenda and finds a positive correlation between RDY, RHP and residential investment demand. Improves previous works including banking sector related variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
